initials taocp is a comprehensive monograph written by donald knuth that covers many kinds of programming algorithms and their analysis knuth began the project originally conceived as a single book with twelve chapters in 1962 the first three volumes of what was then expected to be a sevenvolume set were published in 1968 1969 and 1973 the first published installment of volume 4 appeared in paperback as fascicle 2 in 2005 the hardback volume 4a combining volume 4 fascicles 04 was published in 2011 volume 4 fascicle 6 satisfiability was released in december 2015 to be followed by volume 4 fascicle 5 mathematical preliminaries redux backtracking dancing links in december 2018 fascicles 5 and 6 are expected to comprise the first two thirds of volume 4b history donald knuth in 2005 after winning a westinghouse talent search scholarship knuth enrolled at the case institute of technology now case western reserve university where his performance was so outstanding that the faculty voted to award him a master of science upon his completion of the baccalaureate degree during his summer vacations knuth was hired by the burroughs corporation to write compilers earning more in his summer months than full professors did for an entire year such exploits made knuth a topic of discussion among the mathematics department which included richard s varga knuth started to write a book about compiler design in 1962 and soon realized that the scope of the book needed to be much larger in june 1965 knuth finished the first draft of what was originally planned to be a single volume of twelve chapters his handwritten firstdraft manuscript completed in 1966 was 70033000000000000003000 pages long he had assumed that about five handwritten pages would translate into one printed page but his publisher said instead that about 1 handwritten pages translated to one printed page this meant the book would be approximately 70032000000000000002000 pages in length the publisher was nervous about accepting such a project from a graduate student at this point knuth received support from richard s varga who was the scientific adviser to the publisher varga was visiting olga tausskytodd and john todd at caltech with vargas enthusiastic endorsement the publisher accepted knuths expanded plans in its expanded version the book would be published in seven volumes each with just one or two chapters due to the growth in the material the plan for volume 4 has since expanded to include volumes 4a 4b 4c 4d and possibly more in 1976 knuth prepared a second edition of volume 2 requiring it to be typeset again but the style of type used in the first edition called hot type was no longer available in 1977 he decided to spend some time creating something more suitable eight years later he returned with tex which is currently used for all volumes the offer of a socalled knuth reward check worth one hexadecimal dollar 100hex base 16 cents in decimal is 256 for any errors found and the correction of these errors in subsequent printings has contributed to the highly polished and stillauthoritative nature of the work long after its first publication another characteristic of the volumes is the variation in the difficulty of the exercises the level of difficulty ranges from warmup exercises to unsolved research problems knuths dedication reads this series of books is affectionately dedicatedto the type 650 computer once installed atcase institute of technologywith whom i have spent many pleasant evenings assembly language in the book all examples in the books use a language called mix assembly language which runs on the hypothetical mix computer currently the mix computer is being replaced by the mmix computer which is a risc version software such as gnu mdk exists to provide emulation of the mix architecture knuth considers the use of assembly language necessary for the speed and memory usage of algorithms to be judged critical response knuth was awarded the 1974 turing award for his major contributions to the analysis of algorithms volumes completed volume 1 fundamental algorithms chapter 1 basic concepts chapter 2 information structures volume 2

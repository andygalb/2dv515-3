punched card overpunch redirects here for the cobol code see signed overpunch a punched card or punch card is a piece of stiff paper that can be used to contain digital data represented by the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions digital data can be used for data processing applications or in earlier examples used to directly control automated machinery punched cards were widely used through much of the 20th century in the data processing industry where specialized and increasingly complex unit record machines organized into semiautomatic data processing systems used punched cards for data input output and storage many early digital computers used punched cards often prepared using keypunch machines as the primary medium for input of both computer programs and data while punched cards are now obsolete as a storage medium as of 2012 some voting machines still use punched cards to record votes a punched card from the midtwentieth century closeup of a jacquard looms tape constructed using 8 26 hole punched cards history basile bouchon developed the control of a loom by punched holes in paper tape in 1725 the design was improved by his assistant jeanbaptiste falcon and jacques vaucanson 1740 semyon korsakov was reputedly the first to propose punched cards in informatics for information store and search korsakov announced his new method and machines in september 1832 charles babbage proposed the use of number cards pierced with certain holes and stand opposite levers connected with a set of figure wheels advanced they push in those levers opposite to which there are no holes on the card and thus transfer that number in his description of the calculating engines store in 1881 jules carpentier developed a method of recording and playing back performances on a harmonium using punched cards the system was called the mlographe rptiteur and writes down ordinary music played on the keyboard dans la langage de jacquard at the end of the 1800s herman hollerith invented the recording of data on a medium that could then be read by a machine after some initial trials with paper tape he settled on punched cards developing punched card data processing technology for the 1890 us census hollerith founded the tabulating machine company 1896 which was one of four companies that were amalgamated via stock acquisition to form a fifth company computingtabulatingrecording company ctr 1911 later renamed international business machines corporation ibm 1924 other companies entering the punched card business included the tabulator limited 1902 later renamed the british tabulating machine company deutsche hollerithmaschinen gesellschaft mbh dehomag 1911 powers accounting machine company 1911 remington rand 1927 and hw egli bull 1931 these companies and others manufactured and marketed a variety of punched cards and unit record machines for creating sorting and tabulating punched cards even after the development of electronic computers in the 1950s both ibm and remington rand tied punched card purchases to machine leases a violation of the 1914 clayton antitrust act in 1932 the us government took both to court on this issue remington rand settled quickly ibm viewed its business as providing a service and that the cards were part of the machine ibm fought all the way to the supreme court and lost in 1936 the court ruling that ibm could only set card specifications by 1937 ibm had 32 presses at work in endicott ny printing cutting and stacking five to 10 million punched cards every day during ww ii punched card equipment was used by the allies in some of their efforts to decrypt axis communications see for example central bureau in australia at bletchley park in england 2000000 punched cards were used each week for storing decrypted german messages punched card technology developed into a powerful tool for business dataprocessing by 1950 punched cards had become ubiquitous in industry and government do not fold spindle or mutilate a generalized version of the warning that appeared on some punched cards generally on those distributed as paper documents to be later returned for further machine processing such as checks and utility bills became a motto for the postworld war ii era in 1955 ibm signed a consent decree requiring amongst other things that ibm would by 1962 have no more than onehalf of the punched card manufacturing capacity in the united states tom watson jrs decision to sign this decree where ibm saw the punched card provisions as the most significant point completed the transfer of power to him from thomas watson sr the unityper introduced magnetic tape for data entry in the 1950s during the 1960s the punched card was gradually replaced as the primary means for data storage by magnetic tape as better more capable computers became available mohawk data sciences introduced a magnetic tape encoder in 1965 a system marketed as a keypunch replacement which was somewhat successful punched cards were still commonly used for entering both data and computer programs until the mid1980s when the combination of lower cost magnetic disk storage and affordable interactive terminals on less expensive minicomputers made punched cards obsolete for these roles as well however their influence lives on through many standard conventions and file formats the terminals that replaced the punched cards the ibm 3270 for example displayed 80 columns of text in text mode for compatibility with existing software some programs still operate on the convention of 80 text columns although fewer and fewer do as newer systems employ graphical user interfaces with variablewidth type fonts nomenclature a deck of punched cards comprising a computer program the terms punched card punch card and punchcard were all commonly used as were ibm card and hollerith card after herman hollerith specific formats were often indicated by the number of character positions available eg 80column card a sequence of cards that is input to or output from some step in an applications processing is called a card deck or simply deck the rectangular round or oval bits of paper punched out were called chad chads or chips in ibm usage sequential card columns allocated for a specific use such as names addresses multidigit numbers etc are known as a field the first card of a group of cards containing fixed or indicative information for that group is known as a master card cards that are not master cards are detail cards card formats the hollerith punched cards used for the us 1890 census were blank other cards typically had one upper corner diagonal cut so that cards not oriented correctly or cards with different corner cuts could be identified holleriths early punched card formats hollerith card as shown in the railroad gazette in 1895 with 12 rows and 24 columns herman hollerith was awarded a series of patents in 1889 for electromechanical tabulating machines these patents described both paper tape and rectangular cards as possible recording media the card shown in us patent 395781 of june 8 was printed with a template and had hole positions arranged close to the edges so they could be reached by a railroad conductors ticket punch with the center reserved for written descriptions hollerith was originally inspired by railroad tickets that let the conductor encode a rough description of the passenger i was traveling in the west and i had a ticket with what i think was called a punch photographthe conductorpunched out a description of the individual as light hair dark eyes large nose etc so you see i only made a punch photograph of each person when use of the ticket punch proved tiring and error prone hollerith developed the pantograph keyboard punch it featured an enlarged diagram of the card indicating the positions of the holes to be punched a printed reading board could be placed under a card that was to be read manually hollerith envisioned a number of card sizes in an article he wrote describing his proposed system for tabulating the 1890 us census hollerith suggested a card 3inches by 5 inches of manila stock would be sufficient to answer all ordinary purposes holleriths original system used an adhoc coding system for each application with groups of holes assigned specific meanings eg sex or marital status his tabulating machine had up to 40 counters each with a dial divided into 100 divisions with two indicator hands one which stepped one unit with each counting pulse the other which advanced one unit every time the other dial made a complete revolution this arrangement allowed a count up to 9999 during a given tabulating run counters were assigned specific holes or using relay logic combination of holes later designs led to a card with ten rows each row assigned a digit value 0 through 9 and 45 columns this card provided for fields to record multidigit numbers that tabulators could sum instead of their simply counting cards holleriths 45 column punched cards are illustrated in comries the application of the hollerith tabulating machine to browns tables of the moon ibm 80column punched card format and character codes punched card from a fortran program z1 y w1 by the late 1920s customers wanted to store more data on each punched card thomas j watson sr ibms head asked two of his top inventors clair d lake and j royden peirce to independently develop ways to increase data capacity without increasing the size of the punched card pierce wanted to keep round holes and 45 columns but allow each column to store more data lake suggested rectangular holes which could be spaced more tightly allowing 80 columns per punched card thereby nearly doubling the capacity of the older format this ibm card format introduced in 1928 has rectangular holes 80 columns and 12 rows card size is exactly 738 by 314 inches 187325mm 8255mm the cards are made of smooth stock 0007 inches 180m thick there are about 143 cards to the inch 56cm in 1964 ibm changed from square to round corners initially designed to record responses to yesno questions support for numeric alphabetic and special characters was added through the use of columns and zones the top three positions of a column are called zone punching positions 12 top 11 and 0 0 may be either a zone punch or

characters powerssamas had developed the first commercial alphabetic punched card representation in 19217 binary punched card for some computer applications binary formats were used where each hole represented a single binary digit or bit every column or row is treated as a simple bit field and every combination of holes is permitted invalid lace cards such as these pose mechanical problems for card readers as a prank in binary mode punched cards could be made where every possible punch position had a hole such lace cards lacked structural strength and would frequently buckle and jam inside the machine the ibm 80column punched card format dominated the industry becoming known as just ibm cards even though other companies made cards and equipment to process them a 5081 card from a nonibm manufacturer one of the most common punched card formats is the ibm 5081 card format a general purpose layout with no field divisions this format has digits printed on it corresponding to the punch positions of the digits in each of the 80 columns other punched card vendors manufactured cards with this same layout and number ibm stub card or short card formats the 80column card could be scored on either end creating a stub that could be torn off leaving a stub card or short card ibm 40column portapunch card format ibm portapunch fortran portapunch card compiler directive squeeze removed the

for example artist and architect maya lin in 2004 designed a public art installation at ohio university titled input that looks like a punched card from the air tucker hall at the university of missouri columbia features architecture that is reportedly influenced by punched cards it is said that the spacing and pattern of the windows on the building will spell out miz beat ku on a punched card making reference to the university and states rivalry with neighboring state kansas at the university of wisconsin madison the exterior windows of the engineering research building were modeled

in the 196465 free speech movement punched cards became a metaphor symbol of the systemfirst the registration system and then bureaucratic systems more generally a symbol of alienation punched cards were the symbol of information machines and so they became the symbolic point of attack punched cards used for class registration were first and foremost a symbol of uniformity a student might feel he is one of out of 27500 ibm cards the president of the undergraduate association criticized the university as a machine ibm pattern of education robert blaumer explicated the symbolism he referred to the sense of impersonality symbolized by the ibm technology stevenlubar a legacy of the 80 column punched card format is that a display of 80 characters per row was a common choice in the design of characterbased terminals as of september 2014 some character interface defaults such as the command prompt windows width in microsoft windows remain set at 80 columns and some file formats such as

grace hopper grace brewster murray hopper nemurray december 9 1906 january 1 1992 was an american computer scientist and united states navy rear admiral one of the first programmers of the harvard marki computer she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools she popularized the idea of machineindependent programming languages which led to the development of cobol an early highlevel programming language still in use today hopper attempted to enlist in the navy during world war ii but was rejected because she was 34 years old she instead joined the navy reserves hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the harvard mark i team led by howard h aiken in 1949 she joined the eckertmauchly computer corporation and was part of the team that developed the univac i computer at eckertmauchly she began developing the compiler she believed that a programming language based on english was possible her compiler converted english terms into machine code understood by computers by 1952 hopper had finished her program linker originally called a compiler which was written for the a0 system in 1954 eckertmauchly chose hopper to lead their department for automatic programming and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like flowmatic in 1959 she participated in the codasyl consortium which consulted hopper to guide them in creating a machineindependent programming language this led to the cobol language which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on english words in 1966 she retired from the naval reserve but in 1967 the navy recalled her to active duty she retired from the navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the digital equipment corporation sharing her computing experiences owing to her accomplishments and her naval rank she was sometimes referred to as amazing grace early life and education grace hopper as told by us chief technology officer megan smith problems playing this file see media help hopper was born in new york city she was the eldest of three children her parents walter fletcher murray and mary campbell van horne were of scottish and dutch descent and attended west end collegiate church23 grace was very curious as a child this was a lifelong trait at the age of seven she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing she was then limited to one clock for her preparatory school education she attended the hartridge school in plainfield new jersey hopper was initially rejected for early admission to vassar college at age 16 her test scores in latin were too low but she was admitted the following year she graduated phi beta kappa from vassar in 1928 with a bachelors degree in mathematics and physics and earned her masters degree at yale university in 1930 in 1934 she earned a phd in mathematics from yale she was married to new york university professor vincent foster hopper 190676 from 1930 until their divorce in 1945 she did not marry again but chose to retain his surname career world war ii hoppers signatures on a duty officer signup sheet for the bureau of ships computation project at harvard which built and operated the mark i hopper had tried to enlist in the navy early in world war ii she was rejected for multiple reasons at age 34 she was too old to enlist and her weight to height ratio was too low she was also denied on the basis that her job as a mathematician and mathematics professor at vassar college was valuable to the war effort hopper in a computer room in washington dc 1978 photographed by lynn gilbert univac in 1949 hopper became an employee of the eckertmauchly computer corporation as a senior mathematician and joined the team developing the univac i when hopper recommended the development of a new programming language that would use entirely english words she was told very quickly that 11 in 1952 she had an operational linkloader which at the time was referred to as a compiler she later said that nobody believed that and that she had a running compiler and nobody would touch it they told me computers could only do arithmetic in 1954 hopper was named the companys first director of automatic programming and her department released some of the first compilerbased programming languages including mathmatic and flowmatic cobol hopper at the univac i console c 1960 in the spring of 1959 computer experts from industry and government were brought together in a twoday conference known as the conference on data systems languages codasyl hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee and many of her former employees served on the shortterm committee that defined the new language cobol an acronym for common businessoriented language the new language extended hoppers flowmatic language with some ideas from the ibm equivalent comtran hoppers belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to english rather than in machine code or in languages close to machine code such as assembly languages was captured in the new business language and cobol went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date from 1967 to 1977 hopper served as the director of the navy programming languages group in the navys office of information systems planning and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1973 standards in the 1970s hopper advocated for the defense department to replace large centralized systems with networks of small distributed computers any user on any computer node could access common databases located on the network119 she developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and components most significantly for early programming languages such as fortran and cobol the navy tests for conformance to these standards led to significant convergence among the programming language dialects of the major computer vendors in the 1980s these tests and their official administration were assumed by the national bureau of standards nbs known today as the national institute of standards and technology nist retirement hopper being promoted to the rank of commodore in 1983 in accordance with navy attrition regulations hopper retired from the naval reserve with the rank of commander at age 60 at the end of 1966 after republican representative philip crane saw her on a march 1983 segment of 60 minutes he championed hjres 341 a joint resolution originating in the house of representatives which led to her promotion to commodore by special presidential appointment effective november 8 1985 the rank of commodore was renamed rear admiral lower half and hopper became one of the navys few female admirals following a career that spanned more than 42 years admiral hopper took mandatory retirement from the navy on august 14 1986 at a celebration held in boston on the ussconstitution to commemorate her retirement hopper was awarded the defense distinguished service medal the highest noncombat decoration awarded by the department of defense at the time of her retirement she was the oldest activeduty commissioned officer in the united states navy 79 years eight months and five days and had her retirement ceremony aboard the oldest commissioned ship in the united states navy 188 years nine months and 23 days admirals william d leahy chester w nimitz hyman g rickover and charles stewart were the only other officers in the navys history to serve on active duty at a higher age leahy and nimitz served on active duty for life due to their promotions to the rank of fleet admiral post retirement following her retirement from the navy she was hired as a senior consultant to digital equipment corporation dec hopper was initially offered the job position by rita yavinsky but she insisted on applying for the position at dec and going through the typical formal interview process she also sent a letter to yavinskys boss explaining that she would be available on alternating thursdays receiving a high salary and have access to an unlimited expense account if she were to be exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer after the proposal from hopper she was hired as a fulltime senior consultant as part of her position she would report to yavinsky in this position hopper represented the company at industry forums serving on various industry committees along with other obligations she retained that position until her death at age 85 in 1992 hopper was a goodwill ambassador in her primary activity in this capacity she lectured widely about the early days of computing her career and on efforts that computer vendors could take to make life easier for their users she visited most of digitals engineering facilities where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks she often recounted that during her service she was frequently asked by admirals and generals why satellite communication would take so long so during many of her lectures she illustrated a nanosecond using salvaged obsolete bell system 25 pair telephone cable she cut it to lengths of 118 inches 30cm the distance that light travels in one nanosecond and handed out the individual wires to her listeners although no longer a serving officer she always wore her navy full dress uniform to these lectures which is not allowed under us department of defense regulation 32 cfr 532a2 mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0

forget to take chances anecdotes photo of first computer bug a moth throughout much of her later career hopper was much in demand as a speaker at various computerrelated events she was well known for her lively and irreverent speaking style as well as a rich treasury of early war stories she also received the nickname grandma cobol while she was working on a mark ii computer at harvard university in 1947 grace hopper is famous for her nanoseconds visual aid people such as generals and admirals used to ask her why satellite communication took so long she started handing out pieces of wire that were just under one foot long 118 inches 30cmthe distance that light travels in one nanosecond she gave these pieces of wire the metonym nanoseconds jay elliot described grace hopper as appearing to be all navy but when you reach inside you find a pirate dying to be released death on new years day 1992 hopper died in her sleep of natural causes at her home in arlington virginia she was 85 years

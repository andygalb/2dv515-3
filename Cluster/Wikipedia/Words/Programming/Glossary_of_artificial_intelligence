glossary of artificial intelligence most of the terms listed in wikipedia glossaries are already defined and explained within wikipedia itself however glossaries like this one are useful for looking up comparing and reviewing large numbers of terms together you can help enhance this page by adding new terms or writing definitions for existing ones this glossary of artificial intelligence terms is about artificial intelligence its subdisciplines and related fields artificial intelligence major goals knowledge reasoning planning machine learning natural language processing computer vision robotics artificial general intelligence approaches symbolic deep learning bayesian networks evolutionary algorithms philosophy ethics existential risk turing test chinese room friendly ai history timeline progress ai winter technology applications projects programming languages glossary glossary vte a abductive logic programming abductive logic programming alp is a highlevel knowledgerepresentation framework that can be used to solve problems declaratively based on abductive reasoning it extends normal logic programming by allowing some predicates to be incompletely defined declared as abducible predicates abductive reasoning abductive reasoning also called abduction is a form of logical inference which starts with an observation or set of observations then seeks to find the simplest and most likely explanation this process unlike deductive reasoning yields a plausible conclusion but does not positively verify it abstract data type is a mathematical model for data types where a data type is defined by its behavior semantics from the point of view of a user of the data specifically in terms of possible values possible operations on data of this type and the behavior of these operations abstraction is the process of removing physical spatial or temporal details accelerating change is a perceived increase in the rate of technological change throughout history which may suggest faster and more profound change in the future and may or may not be accompanied by equally profound social and cultural change action language is a language for specifying state transition systems and is commonly used to create formal models of the effects of actions on the world action languages are commonly used in the artificial intelligence and robotics domains where they describe how actions affect the states of systems over time and may be used for automated planning action model learning is an area of machine learning concerned with creation and modification of software agents knowledge about effects and preconditions of the actions that can be executed within its environment this knowledge is usually represented in logicbased action description language and used as the input for automated planners action selection is a way of characterizing the most basic problem of intelligent systems what to do next in artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science the action selection problem is typically associated with intelligent agents and animatsartificial systems that exhibit complex behaviour in an agent environment activation function in artificial neural networks the activation function of a node defines the output of that node or neuron given an input or set of inputs this output is then used as input for the next node and so on until a desired solution to the original problem is found adaptive algorithm an algorithm that changes its behavior at the time it is run based on a priori defined reward mechanism or criterion adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system admissible heuristic in computer science specifically in algorithms related to pathfinding a heuristic function is said to be admissible if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal ie the cost it estimates to reach the goal is not higher than the lowest possible cost from the current point in the path affective computing sometimes called artificial emotional intelligence or emotion ai agent architecture in computer science is a blueprint for software agents and intelligent control systems depicting the arrangement of components

meanunit variance bayesian programming bees algorithm is a populationbased search algorithm which was developed by pham ghanbarzadeh and et al in 2005 behavior informatics behavior tree a behavior tree bt is a mathematical model of plan execution used in computer science robotics control systems and video games they describe switchings between a finite set of tasks in a modular fashion their strength comes from their ability to create very complex tasks composed of simple tasks without worrying how the simple tasks are implemented bts present some similarities to hierarchical state machines with the key difference that the main building block of a behavior is a task rather than a state its ease of human understanding make bts less error prone and very popular in the game developer community bts have shown to generalize several other control architectures beliefdesireintention software model biasvariance tradeoff big data is a term used to refer to data sets that are too large or complex for traditional dataprocessing application software to adequately deal with data with many cases rows offer greater statistical power while data with higher complexity more

to the system ebert test gauges whether a computerbased synthesized voice echo state network the echo state network esn is a recurrent neural network with a sparsely connected hidden layer with typically 1 connectivity the connectivity and weights of hidden neurons are fixed and randomly assigned the weights of output neurons can be learned so that the network can reproduce specific temporal patterns the main interest of this network is that although its behaviour is nonlinear the only weights that are modified during training are for the synapses that connect the hidden neurons to output neurons thus the error function is quadratic with respect to the parameter vector and can be differentiated easily to a linear system embodied agent embodied cognitive science errordriven learning

extraction feature learning feature selection firstorder logic also known as firstorder predicate calculus and predicate logicis a collection of formal systems used in mathematics philosophy linguistics and computer science firstorder logic uses quantified variables over nonlogical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables so that rather than propositions such as socrates is a man one can have expressions in the form there exists x such that x is socrates and x is a man and there exists is a quantifier while x is a variable fluent formal language forward chaining or forward reasoning is one of the two main methods of reasoning when using an inference engine and can be described logically as repeated application of modus ponens forward chaining is a popular implementation strategy for expert systems business and production rule systems the opposite of forward chaining is backward chaining forward chaining starts with the available data and uses inference rules to extract more data from an end user for example until a goal is reached an inference engine using forward chaining searches the inference rules until it finds one where the antecedent if clause is known to be true when such a rule is found the engine can conclude or infer the consequent then clause resulting in the addition of new information to its data frame frame

technique designed for solving a problem more quickly when classic methods are too slow or for finding an approximate solution when classic methods fail to find any exact solution this is achieved by trading optimality completeness accuracy or precision for speed in a way it can be considered a shortcut a heuristic function also called simply a heuristic is a function that ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each branching step based on available information to decide which branch to follow for example it may approximate the exact solution hidden layer an internal layer of neurons in an artificial neural network not dedicated to input or output hidden unit an neuron in a hidden layer in an artificial neural network hyperheuristic is a heuristic search method that seeks to automate often by the incorporation of machine learning techniques the process of selecting combining generating or adapting several simpler heuristics or components of such heuristics to efficiently solve computational search problems one of the motivations for studying hyperheuristics is to build systems which can handle classes of problems rather than solving just one problem i ieee computational

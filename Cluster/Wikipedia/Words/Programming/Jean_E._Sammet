jean e. sammet jean e sammet march 23 1928 may 20 2017 was an american computer scientist who developed the formac programming language in 1962 she was also one of the developers of the influential cobol programming language she received her ba in mathematics from mount holyoke college in 1948 and her ma in mathematics from university of illinois at urbanachampaign in 1949 she received an honorary dsc from mount holyoke college in 1978 sammet was employed by sperry gyroscope from 1955 to 1958 where she supervised the first scientific programming group from 1958 to 1961 she worked for sylvania as a staff consultant for programming research and a member of the original cobol group she joined ibm in 1961 where she developed formac the first widely used computer language for symbolic manipulation of mathematical formulas at ibm she researched the use of restricted english as a programming language and the use of natural language for mathematical programs she was programming technology planning manager for the federal systems division from 1968 to 1974 and was appointed software technology manager in 1979 sammet founded the acm special interest committee on symbolic and algebraic manipulation sicsam in 1965 and was chair of the special interest group on programming languages sigplan she was the first female president of the acm from 1974 to 1976 early life jean e sammet was born on march 23 1928 in new york city jean and her sister helen were born to harry and ruth sammet who were both lawyers jean and helen attended public elementary schools in manhattan sammet had a strong interest in mathematics but was unable to attend the bronx high school of science because it did not accept girls instead sammet attended julia richman high school sammet chose to enroll at mount holyoke college based on the strength of its mathematics program sammet majored in mathematics and took education courses which allowed her to be certified to teach high school mathematics in new york she minored in political science after graduating from mount holyoke sammet pursued graduate studies at the university of illinois where she received her ma in 1949 while taking courses toward a phd she was a teaching assistant in the mathematics department at the university of illinois from 1948 to 1951 in 1951 sammet began looking for a position in education sammet was forced to search for positions in new jersey because new york city was not hiring new teachers the authorities in new jersey determined that sammet was missing two courses from her studies a course in education and one in the history of new jersey sammet fought this determination stating that her knowledge of new jersey history did not strengthen her ability to teach mathematics in high school this forced sammet to seek other types of employment work in 1951 sammet took a position at the metropolitan life insurance company as a trainee actuary she agreed to participate in an inhouse training program to learn about punched card accounting machines sammet took to the electronic accounting machines but was unable to work with the machines after her training was complete she left her position at the insurance office and enrolled at columbia university to pursue a phd in mathematics sammet worked as a teaching assistant at barnard college during the 19521953 school year before she decided that the academic life was not for her from 1953 to 1958 sammet was a mathematician for sperry gyroscope in new york she spent time working on mathematical analysis problems for clients and ran an analog computer sammet worked on the department of the navys submarine program during her time there in early january 1955 sammet began her life as a programmer sperry gyroscope was working on a digital computer the sperry electronic digital automatic computer speedac and asked sammet to be their programmer her first task was to write the basic loader for the speedac which was a 20line program that took three days to toggle into the computer by hand in binary sammet became the group leader of what was called an open shop as sperry began hiring more programmers the open shop consisted of programmers acting as consultants to the engineers and involved scientists who assisted them in writing and testing their routines the group produced other system software and focused on scientific and engineering computations in 1955 sperry gyroscope and remington rand merged and became sperry rand this merger allowed sammet access to the univac i computer and grace hopper in fall of 1956 sammet taught one of the earliest graduatelevel courses in computer programming in the applied mathematics department of adelphi college now university on long island despite the fact that adelphi did not have a computer and few textbooks on programming existed at the time sammet was able to instruct two courses for two years sammet decided to leave sperry to work for a company with computers as its focal point the classifieds at the time were separated by gender and sammet was unable to find a position for a woman in any field she was interested in so she decided to scan the mens list and found an engineer position at sylvania electric products in needham massachusetts sammet was instead hired to oversee software development for the mobidic project by carl hammer the person responsible for sylvanias software development in 1959 sammet and five other programmers established much of the design of the influential cobol programming language in a proposal written in a span of two weeks that was eventually accepted by sylvanias us government clients ties to acm around 1965 or 1966 sammet noticed a need for the exchange of intellectual information with others working with languages and software while she worked on formac in order to gain interest in sicsam sammet wrote letters to people she identified through publications and what was happening in the field at that time she identified people at bell labs carnegie mellon and ibm who were in different divisions and groups sammet faced resistance from the interest group on numerical analysis in acm roughly five years after sicsam formed there was a conference about mathematical software called signum sammet states that she fought her way to give a paper at signum because the group was not interested in nonnumerical analysis of that kind of an activity with assistance from those interested in sicsam sammet organized a conference held in march 1966 which was the symposium on symbolic and algebraic manipulation symsam in june 1966 tony oettinger was elected president of acm and sammet was elected the northeast regional representative 19661968 she was also a member of the acm council and acm lecturer 1967 1968 and 1972 bernie galler was elected president of acm in 1968 and in august 1968 sammet became chairperson of the acm committee on sigs and sics in 1971 she was elected chair of sigplan she served one year of a twoyear term before resigning because she was elected vice president of acm in 1972 as chairperson of sigplan she organized conferences between sigplan and various special interest groups sammet has stated that these conferences were organized based on the recognition of how fundamental programming languages were to different aspects within computing sammet served as vice president of acm from june 1972 to june 1974 working with the president of acm at the time tony ralston sammet made the finances of acm a priority at the time of her vice presidency acm was almost bankrupt sammet convinced ralston to hold a memberoffice forum prior to their annual conference sammet encouraged this based on her recognition that acm had no realistic way of communicating with the membership death sammet died on may 20 2017 in silver spring maryland after a brief illness selected works sammet jean e 1969 programming languages history and fundamentals

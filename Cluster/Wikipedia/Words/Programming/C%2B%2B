c++ cxx redirects here for the roman numerals see 120 number c siplspls see plus plus is a generalpurpose programming language it has imperative objectoriented and generic programming features while also providing facilities for lowlevel memory manipulation it was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded resourceconstrained and large systems with performance efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights c is a compiled language with implementations of it available on many platforms many vendors provide c compilers including the free software foundation microsoft intel and ibm c is standardized by the international organization for standardization iso with the latest standard version ratified and published by iso in december 2017 as isoiec 148822017 informally known as c17 c20 is the next planned standard thereafter many other programming languages have been influenced by c including c d java and newer versions of c history bjarne stroustrup the creator of c in 1979 bjarne stroustrup a danish computer scientist began work on c with classes the predecessor to c c was chosen because it was generalpurpose fast portable and widely used as well as c and simulas influences other languages also influenced c including algol 68 ada clu and ml initially stroustrups c with classes added features to the c compiler cpre including classes derived classes strong typing inlining and default arguments in 1983 c with classes was renamed to c being the increment operator in c adding new features that included virtual functions function name and operator overloading references constants typesafe freestore memory allocation newdelete improved type checking and bcpl style singleline comments with two forward slashes furthermore it included the development of a standalone compiler for c cfront in 1985 the first edition of the c programming language was released which became the definitive reference for the language as there was not yet an official standard in 1989 c 20 was released followed by the updated second edition of the c programming language in 1991 new features in 20 included multiple inheritance abstract classes static member functions const member functions and protected members in 1990 the annotated c reference manual was published this work became the basis for the future standard later feature additions included templates exceptions namespaces new casts and a boolean type after the 20 update c evolved relatively slowly until in 2011 the c11 standard was released adding numerous new features enlarging the standard library further and providing more facilities to c programmers after a minor c14 update released in december 2014 various new additions were introduced in c17 and further changes planned for 2020 as of 2017 c remains the third most popular programming language behind java and c on january 3 2018 stroustrup was announced as the 2018 winner of the charles stark draper prize for engineering for conceptualizing and developing the c programming language etymology according to stroustrup the name signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from c and was first used in december 1983 when mascitti was questioned informally in 1992 about the naming he indicated that it was given in a tongueincheek spirit the name comes from cs operator which increments the value of a variable and a common naming convention of using to indicate an enhanced computer program during cs development period the language had been referred to as new c and c with classes before acquiring its final name philosophy throughout cs life its development and evolution has been guided by a set of principles it must be driven by actual problems and its features should be useful immediately in real world programs every feature should be implementable with a reasonably obvious way to do so programmers should be free to pick their own programming style and that style should be fully supported by c allowing a useful feature is more important than preventing every possible misuse of c it should provide facilities for organising programs into welldefined separate parts and provide facilities for combining separately developed parts no implicit violations of the type system but allow explicit violations that is those explicitly requested by the programmer usercreated types need to have the same support and performance as builtin types unused features should not negatively impact created executables eg in lower performance there should be no language beneath c except assembly language c should work alongside other existing programming languages rather than fostering its own separate and incompatible programming environment if the programmers intent is unknown allow the programmer to specify it by providing manual control standardization year c standard informal name 1998 isoiec 148821998 c98 2003 isoiec 148822003 c03 2011 isoiec 148822011 c11 c0x 2014 isoiec 148822014 c14 c1y 2017 isoiec 148822017 c17 c1z 2020 to be determined c20 c is standardized by an iso working group known as jtc1sc22wg21 so far it has published five revisions of the c standard and is currently working on the next revision c20 in 1998 the iso working group standardized c for the first time as isoiec 148821998 which is informally known as c98 in 2003 it published a new version of the c standard called isoiec 148822003 which fixed problems identified in c98 the next major revision of the standard was informally referred to as c0x but it was not released until 2011 in 2014 c14 also known as c1y was released as a small extension to c11 featuring mainly bug fixes and small improvements after c14 a major revision c17 informally known as c1z was completed by the iso c committee in mid july 2017 and was approved and published in december 2017 as part of the standardization process iso also publishes technical reports and specifications isoiec tr 180152006 on the use of c in

192172015 on the c concepts more technical specifications are in development and pending approval including concurrency library extensions a networking standard library ranges and modules language the c language has two main components a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the c subset and zerooverhead abstractions based on those mappings stroustrup describes c as a lightweight abstraction programming language c inherits most of cs syntax the following is bjarne stroustrups version of the hello world program that uses the c standard library stream facility to write a message to standard output 1 include iostream 2 3 int main 4 5 stdcout hello worldn 6 object storage as in c c supports four types of memory management static storage duration objects thread storage duration objects automatic storage duration objects and dynamic storage duration objects static storage duration objects static storage duration objects are created before main is entered see exceptions below and destroyed in reverse order of creation after main exits the exact order of creation is not specified by the standard though there are some rules defined below to allow implementations some freedom in how to organize their implementation more formally objects of this type have a lifespan that shall last for the duration of the program static storage duration objects are initialized in two phases first static initialization is performed and only after all static initialization is performed dynamic initialization is performed in static initialization all objects are first initialized with zeros after that all objects that have a constant initialization phase are initialized with the constant expression ie variables initialized with a literal or constexpr though it is not specified in the standard the static initialization phase can be completed at compile time and saved in the data partition of the executable dynamic initialization involves all object initialization done via a constructor or function call unless the function is marked with constexpr in c11 the dynamic initialization order is defined as the order of declaration within the compilation unit ie the same file no guarantees are provided about the order of initialization between compilation units thread storage duration objects variables of this type are very similar to static storage duration objects the main difference is the creation time is just prior to thread creation and destruction is done after the thread has been joined automatic storage duration objects the most common variable types in c are local variables inside a function or block and temporary variables the common feature about automatic variables is that they have a lifetime that is limited to the scope of the variable they are created and potentially initialized at the point of declaration see below for details and destroyed in the reverse order of creation when the scope is left this is implemented by allocation on the stack local variables are created as the point of execution passes the declaration point if the variable has a constructor or initializer this is used to define the initial state of the object local variables are destroyed when the local block or function that they are declared in is closed c destructors for local variables are called at the end of the object lifetime allowing a discipline for automatic resource management termed raii which is widely used in c member variables are created when the parent object is created array members are initialized from 0 to the last member of the array in order member variables are destroyed when the parent object is destroyed in the reverse order of creation ie if the parent is an automatic object then it will be destroyed when it goes out of scope which triggers the destruction of all its members temporary variables are created as the result of expression evaluation and are destroyed when the statement containing the expression has been fully evaluated usually at the at the end of a statement dynamic storage duration objects new and delete c these objects have a dynamic lifespan and are created with a call to new and destroyed explicitly with a call to delete templates see also template metaprogramming and generic programming c templates enable generic programming c supports function class alias and variable templates templates may be parameterized by types compiletime constants and other templates templates are implemented by instantiation at compiletime to instantiate a template compilers substitute specific arguments for a templates parameters to generate a concrete function or class instance some substitutions are not possible these are eliminated by an overload resolution policy described by the phrase substitution failure is not an error sfinae templates are a powerful tool that can be used for generic programming template metaprogramming and code optimization but this power implies a cost template use may increase code size because each template instantiation produces a copy of the template code one for each set of template arguments however this is the same or smaller amount of code that would be generated if the code was written by hand this is in contrast to runtime generics seen in other languages eg java where at compiletime the type is erased and a single template body is preserved templates are different from macros while both of these compiletime language features enable conditional compilation templates are not restricted to lexical substitution templates are aware of the semantics and type system of their companion language as well as all compiletime type definitions and can perform highlevel operations including programmatic flow control based on evaluation of strictly typechecked parameters macros are capable of conditional control over compilation based on predetermined criteria but cannot instantiate new types recurse or perform type evaluation and in effect are limited to precompilation textsubstitution and textinclusionexclusion in other words macros can control compilation flow based on predefined symbols but cannot unlike templates independently instantiate new symbols templates are a tool for static polymorphism see below and generic programming in addition templates are a compile time mechanism in c that is turingcomplete meaning that any computation expressible by a computer program can be computed in some form by a template metaprogram prior to runtime in summary a template is a compiletime parameterized function or class written without knowledge of the specific arguments used to instantiate it after instantiation the resulting code is equivalent to code written specifically for the passed arguments in this manner templates provide a way to decouple generic broadly applicable aspects of functions and classes encoded in templates from specific aspects encoded in template parameters without sacrificing performance due to abstraction objects c classes c introduces objectoriented programming oop features to c it offers classes which provide the four features commonly present in oop and some nonoop languages abstraction encapsulation inheritance and polymorphism one distinguishing feature of c classes compared to classes in other programming languages is support for deterministic destructors which in turn provide support for the resource acquisition is initialization raii concept encapsulation encapsulation is the hiding of information to ensure that data structures and operators are used as intended and to make the usage model more obvious to the developer c provides the ability to define classes and functions as its primary encapsulation mechanisms within a class members can be declared as either public protected or private to explicitly enforce encapsulation a public member of the class is accessible to any function a private member is accessible only to functions that are members of that class and to functions and classes explicitly granted access permission by the class friends a protected member is accessible to members of classes that inherit from the class in addition to the class itself and any friends the objectoriented principle ensures the encapsulation of all and only the functions that access the internal representation of a type c supports this principle via member functions and friend functions but it does not enforce it programmers can declare parts or all of the representation of a type to be public and they are allowed to make public entities not part of the representation of a type therefore c supports not just objectoriented programming but other decomposition paradigms such as modular programming it is generally considered good practice to make all data private or protected and to make public only those functions that are part of a minimal interface for users of the class this can hide the details of data implementation allowing the designer to later fundamentally change the implementation without changing the interface in any way inheritance inheritance allows one data type to acquire properties of other data types inheritance from a base class may be declared as public protected or private this access specifier determines whether unrelated and derived classes can access the inherited public and protected members of the base class only public inheritance corresponds to what is usually meant by inheritance the other two forms are much less frequently used if the access specifier is omitted a class inherits privately while a struct inherits publicly base classes may be declared as virtual this is called virtual inheritance virtual inheritance ensures that only one instance of a base class exists in the inheritance graph avoiding some of the ambiguity problems of multiple inheritance multiple inheritance is a c feature not found in most other languages allowing a class to be derived from more than one base class this allows for more elaborate inheritance relationships for example a flying cat class can inherit from both cat and flying mammal some other languages such as c or java accomplish something similar although more limited by allowing inheritance of multiple interfaces while restricting the number of base classes to one interfaces unlike classes provide only declarations of member functions no implementation or member data an interface as in c and java can be defined in c as a class containing only pure virtual functions often known as an abstract base class or abc the member functions of such an abstract base class are normally explicitly defined in the derived class not inherited implicitly c virtual inheritance exhibits an ambiguity resolution feature called dominance operators and operator overloading operators that cannot be overloaded operator symbol scope resolution operator conditional operator dot operator member selection operator sizeof operator sizeof typeid operator typeid operators in c and c c provides more than 35 operators covering basic arithmetic bit manipulation indirection comparisons logical operations and others almost all operators can be overloaded for userdefined types with a few notable exceptions such as member access and as well as the conditional operator the rich set of overloadable operators is central to making userdefined types in c seem like builtin types overloadable operators are also an essential part of many advanced c programming techniques such as smart pointers overloading an operator does not change the precedence of calculations involving the operator nor does it change the number of operands that the operator uses any operand may however be ignored by the operator though it will be evaluated prior to execution overloaded and operators lose their shortcircuit evaluation property polymorphism see also polymorphism computer science polymorphism enables one common interface for many implementations and for objects to act differently under different circumstances c supports several kinds of static resolved at compiletime and dynamic resolved at runtime polymorphisms supported by the language features described above compiletime polymorphism does not allow for certain runtime decisions while runtime polymorphism typically incurs a performance penalty static polymorphism see also parametric polymorphism and ad hoc polymorphism function overloading allows programs to declare multiple functions having the same name but with different arguments ie ad hoc polymorphism the functions are distinguished by the number or types of their formal parameters thus the same function name can refer to different functions depending on the context in which it is used the type returned by the function is not used to distinguish overloaded functions and would result in a compiletime error message when declaring a function a programmer can specify for one or more parameters a default value doing so allows the parameters with defaults to optionally be omitted when the function is called in which case the default arguments will be used when a function is called with fewer arguments than there are declared parameters explicit arguments are matched to parameters in lefttoright order with any unmatched parameters at the end of the parameter list being assigned their default arguments in many cases specifying default arguments in a single function declaration is preferable to providing overloaded function definitions with different numbers of parameters templates in c provide a sophisticated mechanism for writing generic polymorphic code ie parametric polymorphism in particular through the curiously recurring template pattern its possible to implement a form of static polymorphism that closely mimics the syntax for overriding virtual functions because c templates are typeaware and turingcomplete they can also be used to let the compiler resolve recursive conditionals and generate substantial programs through template metaprogramming contrary to some opinion template code will not generate a bulk code after compilation with the proper compiler settings dynamic polymorphism inheritance see also subtyping variable pointers and references to a base class type in c can also refer to objects of any derived classes of that type this allows arrays and other kinds of containers to hold pointers to objects of differing types references cannot be directly held in containers this enables dynamic runtime polymorphism where the referred objects can behave differently depending on their actual derived types c also provides the dynamiccast operator which allows code to safely attempt conversion of an object via a base referencepointer to a more derived type downcasting the attempt is necessary as often one does not know which derived type is referenced upcasting conversion to a more general type can always be checkedperformed at compiletime via staticcast as ancestral classes are specified in the derived classs interface visible to all callers dynamiccast relies on runtime type information rtti metadata in the program that enables differentiating types and their relationships if a dynamiccast to a pointer fails the result is the nullptr constant whereas if the destination is a reference which cannot be null the cast throws an exception objects known to be of a certain derived type can be cast to that with staticcast bypassing rtti and the safe runtime typechecking of dynamiccast so this should be used only if the programmer is very confident the cast is and will always be valid virtual member functions ordinarily when a function in a derived class overrides a function in a base class the function to call is determined by the type of the object a given function is overridden when there exists no difference in the number or type of parameters between two or more definitions of that function hence at compile time it may not be possible to determine the type of the object and therefore the correct function to call given only a base class pointer the decision is therefore put off until runtime this is called dynamic dispatch virtual member functions or methods allow the most specific implementation of the function to be called according to the actual runtime type of the object in c implementations this is commonly done using virtual function tables if the object type is known this may be bypassed by prepending a fully qualified class name before the function call but in general calls to virtual functions are resolved at run time in addition to standard member functions operator overloads and destructors can be virtual as a rule of thumb if any function in the class is virtual the destructor should be as well as the type of an object at its creation is known at compile time constructors and by extension copy constructors cannot be virtual nonetheless a situation may arise where a copy of an object needs to be created when a pointer to a derived object is passed as a pointer to a base object in such a case a common solution is to create a clone or similar virtual function that creates and returns a copy of the derived class when called a member function can also be made pure virtual by appending it with 0 after the closing parenthesis and before the semicolon a class containing a pure virtual function is called an abstract class objects cannot be created from an abstract class they can only be derived from any derived class inherits the virtual function as pure and must provide a nonpure definition of it and all other pure virtual functions before objects of the derived class can be created a program that attempts to create an object of a class with a pure virtual member function or inherited pure virtual member function is illformed lambda expressions c provides support for anonymous functions also known as lambda expressions with the following form parameters returntype functionbody the list supports the definition of closures such lambda expressions are defined in the standard as syntactic sugar for an unnamed function object an example lambda function may be defined as follows int x int y int return x y exception handling exception handling is used to communicate the existence of a runtime problem or error from where it was detected to where the issue can be handled note that many c styles like googles forbid usage of exceptions in c programs restricting the language thusly the exceptioncausing code is placed inside a try block the exceptions are handled in separate catch blocks the handlers each try block can have multiple exception handlers as it is visible in the example below 1 include iostream 2 include vector 3 include stdexcept 4 5 int main 6 try 7 stdvectorint vec3 4 3 1 8 int ivecat4 throws an exception stdoutofrange indexing for vec is from 03 not 14 9 10 an exception handler catches stdoutofrange which is thrown by vecat4 11 catch stdoutofrange e 12 stdcerr accessing a nonexistent element ewhat n 13 14 to catch any other standard library exceptions they derive from stdexception 15 catch stdexception e 16 stdcerr exception thrown ewhat n 17 18 catch any unrecognised exceptions ie those which dont derive from stdexception 19 catch 20 stdcerr some fatal errorn 21 22 it is also possible to raise exceptions purposefully using the throw keyword these exceptions are handled in the usual way in some cases exceptions cannot be used due to technical reasons one such example is a critical component of an embedded system where every operation must be guaranteed to complete within a specified amount of time this cannot be determined with exceptions as no tools exist to determine the maximum time required for an exception to be handled standard library c standard library the c standard consists of two parts the core language and the standard library c programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of c it includes aggregate types vectors lists maps sets queues stacks arrays tuples algorithms find foreach binarysearch randomshuffle etc inputoutput facilities iostream for reading from and writing to the console and files filesystem library localisation support smart pointers for automatic memory management regular expression support multithreading library atomics support allowing a variable to be read or written to by at most one thread at a time without any external synchronisation time utilities measurement getting current time etc a system for converting error reporting that doesnt use c exceptions into c exceptions a random number generator and a slightly modified version of the c standard library to make it comply with the c type system a large part of the c library is based on the standard template library stl useful tools provided by the stl include containers as the collections of objects such as vectors and lists iterators that provide arraylike access to containers and algorithms that perform operations such as searching and sorting furthermore multimaps associative arrays and multisets are provided all of which export compatible interfaces therefore using templates it is possible to write generic algorithms that work with any container or on any sequence defined by iterators as in c the features of the library are accessed by using the include directive to include a standard header the c standard library provides 105 standard headers of which 27 are deprecated the standard incorporates the stl that was originally designed by alexander stepanov who experimented with generic algorithms and containers for many years when he started with c he finally found a language where it was possible to create generic algorithms eg stl sort that perform even better than for example the c standard library qsort thanks to c features like using inlining and compiletime binding instead of function pointers the standard does not refer to it as stl as it is merely a part of the standard library but the term is still widely used to distinguish it from the rest of the standard library inputoutput streams internationalization diagnostics the c library subset etc most c compilers and all major ones provide a standardsconforming implementation of the c standard library compatibility to give compiler vendors greater freedom the c standards committee decided not to dictate the implementation of name mangling exception handling and other implementationspecific features the downside of this decision is that object code produced by different compilers is expected to be incompatible there were however attempts to standardize compilers for particular machines or operating systems for example c abi though they seem to be largely abandoned now with c further information compatibility of c and c c is often considered to be a superset of c but this is not strictly true most c code can easily be made to compile correctly in c but there are a few differences that cause some valid c code to be invalid or behave differently in c for example c allows implicit conversion from void to other pointer types but c does not for type safety reasons also c defines many new keywords such as new and class which may be used as identifiers for example variable names in a c program some incompatibilities have been removed by the 1999 revision of the c standard c99 which now supports c features such as line comments and declarations mixed with code on the other hand c99 introduced a number of new features that c did not support were incompatible or redundant in c such as variablelength arrays native complexnumber types however the stdcomplex class in the c standard library provides similar functionality although not codecompatible designated initializers compound literals and the restrict keyword however the c11 standard introduces new incompatibilities such as disallowing assignment of a string literal to a character pointer which remains valid c to intermix c and c code any function declaration or definition that is to be called fromused both in c and c must be declared with c linkage by placing it within an extern c block such a function may not rely on features depending on name mangling ie function overloading criticism criticism of c despite its widespread adoption some notable programmers have criticized the c language including linus torvalds one of the most often criticised points of c is its perceived complexity as a language with the criticism that a large number of nonorthogonal features in practice necessitates restricting code to subset of c thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms as expressed by joshua bloch i think c was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold and yet there are a lot of people programming it but what you do is you force people to subset it so almost every shop that i know of that uses c says yes were using c but were not doing multipleimplementation inheritance and were not using operator overloading there are just a bunch of features that youre not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high and i dont think its good when you have to start doing that you lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone elses code which i think is such a good thing donald knuth 1993 commenting on prestandardized c who said of edsger dijkstra that to think of programming in c would make him physically ill the problem that i have with them today is that c is too complicated at the moment its impossible for me to write portable code that i believe would work on lots of different systems unless i avoid all exotic features whenever the c language designers had two competing ideas as to how they should solve some problem they said ok well do them both so the language is too baroque for my taste ken thompson who was a colleague of stroustrup at bell labs gives his assessment it certainly has its good points but by and large i think its a bad language it does a lot of things half well and its just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive everybody i know whether its personal or corporate selects a subset and these subsets are different so its not a good language to transport an algorithmto say i wrote it here take it its way too big way too complex and its obviously built by a committee stroustrup campaigned for years and years and years way beyond any sort of technical contributions he made to the language to get it adopted and used and he sort of ran all the standards committees with a whip and a chair and he said no to no one he put every feature in that language that ever existed it wasnt cleanly designedit was just the union of everything that came along and i think it suffered drastically from that however brian kernighan also a colleague at bell labs disputes this assessment c has been enormously influential lots of people say c is too big and too complicated etc etc but in fact it is a very powerful language and pretty much everything that is in there is there for a really sound reason it is not somebody doing random invention it is actually people trying to solve real world problems now a lot of the programs that we take for granted today that we just use are c programs stroustrup himself comments that within c there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out other complaints may include a lack of reflection or garbage collection slow

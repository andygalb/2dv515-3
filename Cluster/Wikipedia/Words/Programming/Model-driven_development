computer science electrical and electronics engineering vte modeldriven engineering mde is a software development methodology that focuses on creating and exploiting domain models which are conceptual models of all the topics related to a specific problem hence it highlights and aims at abstract representations of the knowledge and activities that govern a particular application domain rather than the computing ie algorithmic concepts overview the mde approach is meant to increase productivity by maximizing compatibility between systems via reuse of standardized models simplifying the process of design via models of recurring design patterns in the application domain and promoting communication between individuals and teams working on the system via a standardization of the terminology and the best practices used in the application domain a modeling paradigm for mde is considered effective if its models make sense from the point of view of a user that is familiar with the domain and if they can serve as a basis for implementing systems the models are developed through extensive communication among product managers designers developers and users of the application domain as the models approach completion they enable the development of software and systems some of the better known mde initiatives are the object management group omg initiative modeldriven architecture mda which is leveraged by several of their standards such as metaobject facility xmi cwm corba unified modeling language to be more precise the omg currently promotes the use of a subset of uml called fuml together with its action language alf for modeldriven architecture a former approach relied on executable uml and ocl instead and qvt the eclipse ecosystem of programming and modelling tools represented in general terms by the eclipse modeling framework this framework allows the creation of tools implementing the mda standards of the omg but it is also possible to use it to implement other modelingrelated tools history the first tools to support mde were the computeraided software engineering case tools developed in the 1980s companies like integrated development environments ide stp higher order software now hamilton technologies inc hti cadre technologies bachman information systems and logic works bpwin and erwin were pioneers in the field the us government got involved in the modeling definitions creating the idef specifications with several variations of the modeling definitions see booch rumbaugh jacobson gane and sarson harel shlaer and mellor and others they were eventually joined creating the unified modeling language uml rational rose a product for uml implementation was done by rational corporation booch responding automation yield higher levels of abstraction in software development this abstraction promotes simpler models with a greater focus on problem space combined with executable semantics this elevates the total level of automation possible the object management group omg has developed a set of standards called modeldriven architecture mda building a foundation for this advanced architecturefocused approach according to douglas c schmidt modeldriven engineering technologies offer a promising approach to address the inability of thirdgeneration languages to alleviate the complexity of platforms and express domain concepts

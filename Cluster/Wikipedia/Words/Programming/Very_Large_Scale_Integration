very large scale integration vlsi redirects here for the former company see vlsi technology verylargescale integration vlsi is the process of creating an integrated circuit ic by combining hundreds of thousands of transistors or devices into a single chip vlsi began in the 1970s when complex semiconductor and communication technologies were being developed the microprocessor is a vlsi device before the introduction of vlsi technology most ics had a limited set of functions they could perform an electronic circuit might consist of a cpu rom ram and other glue logic vlsi lets ic designers add all of these into one chip a vlsi integratedcircuit die history the history of the transistor dates to the 1920s when several inventors attempted devices that were intended to control current in solidstate diodes and convert them into triodes success came after world war ii when the use of silicon and germanium crystals as radar detectors led to improvements in fabrication and theory scientists who had worked on radar returned to solidstate device development with the invention of transistors at bell labs in 1947 the field of electronics shifted from vacuum tubes to solidstate device with the small transistor at their hands electrical engineers of the 1950s saw the possibilities of constructing far more advanced circuits however as the complexity of circuits grew problems arose one problem was the size of the circuit a complex circuit like a computer was dependent on speed if the components were large the wires interconnecting them must be long the electric signals took time to go through the circuit thus slowing the computer the invention of the integrated circuit by jack kilby and robert noyce solved this problem by making all the components and the chip out of the same block monolith of semiconductor material the circuits could be made smaller and the manufacturing process could be automated this led to the idea of integrating all components on a singlecrystal silicon wafer which led to smallscale integration ssi in the early 1960s mediumscale integration msi in the late 1960s and then largescale integration lsi as well as vlsi in the 1970s and 1980s with tens of thousands of transistors on a single chip later hundreds of thousands then millions and now billions 109 developments the first semiconductor chips held two transistors each subsequent advances added more transistors and as a consequence more individual functions or systems were integrated over time the first integrated circuits held only a few devices perhaps as many as ten diodes transistors resistors and capacitors making it possible to fabricate one or more logic gates on a single device now known retrospectively as smallscale integration ssi improvements in technique led to devices with hundreds of logic gates known as mediumscale integration msi further improvements led to largescale integration lsi ie systems with at least a thousand logic gates current technology has moved far past this mark and todays microprocessors have many millions of gates and billions of individual transistors at one time there was an effort to name and calibrate various levels of largescale integration above vlsi terms like ultralargescale integration ulsi were used but the huge number of gates and transistors available on common devices has rendered such fine distinctions moot terms suggesting greater than vlsi levels of integration are no longer in widespread use in 2008 billiontransistor processors became commercially available this became more commonplace as semiconductor fabrication advanced from the thencurrent generation of 65nm processes current designs unlike the earliest devices use extensive design automation and automated logic synthesis to lay out the transistors enabling higher levels of complexity in the resulting logic functionality certain highperformance logic blocks like the sram static randomaccess memory cell are still designed by hand to ensure the highest efficiency structured design structured vlsi design is a modular methodology originated by carver mead and lynn conway for saving microchip area by minimizing the interconnect fabrics area this is obtained by repetitive arrangement of rectangular macro blocks which can be interconnected using wiring by abutment an example is partitioning the layout of an adder into a row of equal bit slices cells in complex designs this structuring may be achieved by hierarchical nesting structured vlsi design had been popular in the early 1980s but lost its popularity later because of the advent of placement and routing tools wasting a lot of area by routing which is tolerated because of the progress of moores law when introducing the hardware description language karl in the mid 1970s reiner hartenstein coined the term structured vlsi design originally as structured lsi design echoing edsger dijkstras structured programming approach by procedure nesting to avoid chaotic spaghettistructured program difficulties as microprocessors become more complex due to technology scaling microprocessor designers have encountered several challenges which force them to think beyond the design plane and look ahead to postsilicon process variation as photolithography techniques get closer to the fundamental laws of optics achieving high accuracy in doping concentrations and etched wires is becoming more difficult and prone to errors due to variation designers now must simulate across multiple fabrication process corners before a chip is certified ready for production or use systemlevel techniques for dealing with effects of variation stricter design rules due to lithography and etch issues with scaling design rules for layout have become increasingly stringent designers must keep in mind an ever increasing list of rules when laying out custom circuits the overhead for custom design is now reaching a tipping point with many design houses opting to switch to electronic design automation eda tools to automate their design process timingdesign closure as clock frequencies tend to scale up designers are finding it more difficult to distribute and maintain low clock skew between these high frequency clocks across the entire chip this has led to a rising interest in multicore and multiprocessor architectures since an overall speedup can be obtained even with lower clock frequency by using the computational power of all the cores firstpass success as die sizes shrink due to scaling and wafer sizes go up due to lower manufacturing costs the number of dies per wafer increases and the complexity of making suitable photomasks goes up rapidly a mask set for a modern technology can cost several million dollars this nonrecurring expense deters the old iterative philosophy involving several spincycles to find errors in silicon and encourages firstpass silicon success several design philosophies have been developed to aid this new design flow including design for manufacturing dfm design for test dft and design for x system on chip soc neuromorphic engineering applicationspecific integrated circuit

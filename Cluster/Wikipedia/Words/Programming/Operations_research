operations research for the academic journal see operations research operations research or operational research in british usage is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions further the term operational analysis is used in the british and some british commonwealth military as an intrinsic part of capability development management and assurance in particular operational analysis forms part of the combined operational effectiveness and investment appraisals coeia which support british defense capability acquisition decisionmaking it is often considered to be a subfield of applied mathematics employing techniques from other mathematical sciences such as mathematical modeling statistical analysis and mathematical optimization operations research arrives at optimal or nearoptimal solutions to complex decisionmaking problems because of its emphasis on humantechnology interaction and because of its focus on practical applications operations research has overlap with other disciplines notably industrial engineering and operations management and draws on psychology and organization science operations research is often concerned with determining the maximum of profit performance or yield or minimum of loss risk or cost of some realworld objective originating in military efforts before world war ii its techniques have grown to concern problems in a variety of industries overview operational research or encompasses a wide range of problemsolving techniques and methods applied in the pursuit of improved decisionmaking and efficiency such as simulation mathematical optimization queueing theory and other stochasticprocess models markov decision processes econometric methods data envelopment analysis neural networks expert systems decision analysis and the analytic hierarchy process nearly all of these techniques involve the construction of mathematical models that attempt to describe the system because of the computational and statistical nature of most of these fields or also has strong ties to computer science and analytics operational researchers faced with a new problem must determine which of these techniques are most appropriate given the nature of the system the goals for improvement and constraints on time and computing power the major subdisciplines in modern operational research as identified by the journal operations research are computing and information technologies financial engineering manufacturing service sciences and supply chain management policy modeling and public sector work revenue management simulation stochastic models transportation history as a discipline operational research originated in the efforts of military planners during world war i convoy theory and lanchesters laws in the decades after the two world wars the techniques were more widely applied to problems in business industry and society since that time operational research has expanded into a field widely used in industries ranging from petrochemicals to airlines finance logistics and government moving to a focus on the development of mathematical models that can be used to analyse and optimize complex systems and has become an area of active academic and industrial research historical origins early work in operational research was carried out by individuals such as charles babbage his research into the cost of transportation and sorting of mail led to englands universal penny post in 1840 and studies into the dynamical behaviour of railway vehicles in defence of the gwrs broad gauge modern operational research originated at the bawdsey research station in the uk in 1937 and was the result of an initiative of the stations superintendent a p rowe rowe conceived the idea as a means to analyse and improve the working of the uks early warning radar system chain home ch initially he analysed the operating of the radar equipment and its communication networks expanding later to include the operating personnels behaviour this revealed unappreciated limitations of the ch network and allowed remedial action to be taken scientists in the united kingdom including patrick blackett later lord blackett om prs cecil gordon solly zuckerman later baron zuckerman om kcb frs c h waddington owen wansbroughjones frank yates jacob bronowski and freeman dyson and in the united states with george dantzig looked for ways to make better decisions in such areas as logistics and training schedules second world war the modern field of operational research arose during world war ii in the world war ii era operational research was defined as a scientific method of providing executive departments with a quantitative basis for decisions regarding the operations under their control during the second world war close to 1000 men and women in britain were engaged in operational research about 200 operational research scientists worked for the british army patrick blackett worked for several different organizations during the war early in the war while working for the royal aircraft establishment rae he set up a team known as the circus which helped to reduce the number of antiaircraft artillery rounds needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft from an average of over 20000 at the start of the battle of britain to 4000 in 1941 a liberator in standard raf greendark earthblack night bomber finish as originally used by coastal command in 1941 blackett moved from the rae to the navy after first working with raf coastal command in 1941 and then early in 1942 to the admiralty while performing an analysis of the methods used by raf coastal command to hunt and destroy submarines one of the analysts asked what colour the aircraft were as most of them were from bomber command they were painted black for nighttime operations at the suggestion of ccors a test was run to see if that was the best colour to camouflage the aircraft for daytime operations in the grey north atlantic skies tests showed that aircraft painted white were on average not spotted until they were 20 closer than those painted black this change indicated that 30 more submarines would be attacked and sunk for the same number of sightings as a result of these findings coastal command changed their aircraft to using white undersurfaces other work by the ccors indicated that on average if the trigger depth of aerialdelivered depth charges dcs were changed from 100 feet to 25 feet the kill ratios would go up the reason was that if a uboat saw an aircraft only shortly before it arrived over the target then at 100 feet the charges would do no damage because the uboat wouldnt have had time to descend as far as 100 feet and if it saw the aircraft a long way from the target it had time to alter course under water so the chances of it being within the 20foot kill zone of the charges was small it was more efficient to attack those submarines close to the surface when the targets locations were better known than to attempt their destruction at greater depths when their positions could only be guessed before the change of settings from 100 feet to 25 feet 1 of submerged uboats were sunk and 14 damaged after the change 7 were sunk and 11 damaged if submarines were caught on the surface even if attacked shortly after submerging the numbers rose to 11 sunk and 15 damaged blackett observed there can be few cases where such a great operational gain had been obtained by such a small and simple change of tactics map of kammhuber line bomber commands operational research section bcors analysed a report of a survey carried out by raf bomber command when germany organised its air defences into the kammhuber line it was realised by the british that if the raf bombers were to fly in a bomber stream they could overwhelm the night fighters who flew in individual cells directed to their targets by ground controllers it was then a matter of calculating the statistical loss from collisions against the statistical loss from night fighters to calculate how close the bombers should fly to minimise raf losses the exchange rate ratio of output to input was a characteristic feature of operational research by comparing the number of flying hours put in by allied aircraft to the number of uboat sightings in a given area it was possible to redistribute aircraft to more productive patrol areas comparison of exchange rates established effectiveness ratios useful in planning the ratio of 60 mines laid per ship sunk was common to several campaigns german mines in british ports british mines on german routes and united states mines in japanese routes operational research doubled the ontarget bomb rate of b29s bombing japan from the marianas islands by increasing the training ratio from 4 to 10 percent of flying hours revealed that wolfpacks of three united states submarines were the most effective number to enable all members of the pack to engage targets discovered on their individual patrol stations revealed that glossy enamel paint was more effective camouflage for night fighters than traditional dull camouflage paint finish and the smooth paint finish increased airspeed by reducing skin friction on land the operational research sections of the army operational research group aorg of the ministry of supply mos were landed in normandy in 1944 and they followed british forces in the advance across europe they analysed among other topics the effectiveness of artillery aerial bombing and antitank shooting after world war ii with expanded techniques and growing awareness of the field at the close of the war operational research was no longer limited to only operational but was extended to encompass equipment procurement training logistics and infrastructure operations research also grew in many areas other than the military once scientists learned to apply its principles to the civilian sector with the development of the simplex algorithm for linear programming in 1947 problems addressed critical path analysis or project planning identifying those processes in a complex project which affect the overall duration of the project floorplanning designing the layout of equipment in a factory or components on a computer chip to reduce manufacturing time therefore reducing cost network optimization for instance setup of telecommunications networks to maintain quality of service during outages allocation problems facility location assignment problems assignment problem generalized assignment problem quadratic assignment problem weapon target assignment problem bayesian search theory looking for a target optimal search routing such as determining the routes of buses so that as few buses are needed as possible supply chain management managing the flow of raw materials and products based on uncertain demand for the finished products project production activities managing the flow of work activities in a capital project in response to system variability through operations research tools for variability reduction and buffer allocation using a combination of allocation of capacity inventory and time efficient messaging and customer response tactics automation automating or integrating robotic systems in humandriven operations processes globalization globalizing operations processes in order to take advantage of cheaper materials labor land or other productivity inputs transportation managing freight transportation and delivery systems examples ltl shipping intermodal freight transport travelling salesman problem scheduling personnel staffing manufacturing steps project tasks network data traffic these are known as queueing models or queueing systems sports events and their television coverage blending of raw materials in oil refineries determining optimal prices in many retail and b2b settings within the disciplines of pricing science cutting stock problem cutting small items out of bigger ones operational research is also used extensively in government where evidencebased policy is used management science management science in 1967 stafford beer characterized the field of management science as the business use of operations research like operational research itself management science ms is an interdisciplinary branch of applied mathematics devoted to optimal decision planning with strong links with economics business engineering and other sciences it uses various scientific researchbased principles strategies and analytical methods including mathematical modeling statistics and numerical algorithms to improve an organizations ability to enact rational and meaningful management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems management scientists help businesses to achieve their goals using the scientific methods of operational research the management scientists mandate is to use rational systematic sciencebased techniques to inform and improve decisions of all kinds of course the techniques of management science are not restricted to business applications but may be applied to military medical public administration charitable groups political groups or community groups management science is concerned with developing and applying models and concepts that may prove useful in helping to illuminate management issues and solve managerial problems as well as designing and developing new and better models of organizational excellence the application of these models within the corporate sector became known as management science related fields some of the fields that have considerable overlap with operations research and management science include business analytics data miningdata sciencebig data decision analysis engineering financial engineering forecasting game theory geographygeographic information science graph theory industrial engineering logistics mathematical modeling mathematical optimization probability and statistics project management policy analysis simulation social networktransportation forecasting models stochastic processes supply chain management applications applications are abundant such as in airlines manufacturing companies service organizations military branches and government the range of problems and issues to which it has contributed insights and solutions is vast it includes scheduling of airlines trains buses etc assignment assigning crew to flights trains or buses employees to projects facility location deciding most appropriate location for new facilities such as warehouse factory or fire station hydraulics piping engineering managing flow of water from reservoirs health services information and supply chain management game theory identifying understanding developing strategies adopted by companies urban design computer network engineering packet routing timing analysis telecom data communication engineering packet routing timing analysis management is also concerned with socalled softoperational analysis which concerns methods for strategic planning strategic decision support problem structuring methods in dealing with these sorts of challenges mathematical modeling and simulation may not be appropriate or may not suffice therefore during the past 30 years stakeholder based approaches including metagame analysis and drama theory morphological analysis and various forms of influence diagrams cognitive mapping strategic choice robustness analysis societies and

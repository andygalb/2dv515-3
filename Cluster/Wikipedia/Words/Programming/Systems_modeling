systems modeling example of an idef0 function model functional flow block diagram format decomposition structure static dynamic and requirements models for systems partition business process modeling notation example systems modeling or system modeling is the interdisciplinary study of the use of models to conceptualize and construct systems in business and it development a common type of systems modeling is function modeling with specific techniques such as the functional flow block diagram and idef0 these models can be extended using functional decomposition and can be linked to requirements models for further systems partition contrasting the functional modeling another type of systems modeling is architectural modeling which uses the systems architecture to conceptually model the structure behavior and more views of a system the business process modeling notation bpmn a graphical representation for specifying business processes in a workflow can also be considered to be a systems modeling language overview in business and it development the term systems modeling has multiple meanings it can relate to the use of model to conceptualize and construct systems the interdisciplinary study of the use of these models the systems modeling analysis and design efforts the systems modeling and simulation such as system dynamics any specific systems modeling language as a field of study systems modeling has emerged with the development of system theory and systems sciences as a type of modeling systems modeling is based on systems thinking and the systems approach in business and it systems modeling contrasts other approaches such as agent based modeling data modeling and mathematical modeling in methodology for creating business knowledge 1997 arbnor and bjerke the systems approach systems modeling was considered to be one of the three basic methodological approaches for gaining business knowledge beside the analytical approach and the actors approach agent based modeling history the function model originates in the 1950s after in the first half of the 20th century other types of management diagrams had already been developed the first known gantt chart was developed in 1896 by karol adamiecki who called it a harmonogram because adamiecki did not publish his chart until 1931 and in any case his works were published in either polish or russian languages not popular in the west the chart now bears the name of henry gantt 18611919 who designed his chart around the years 19101915 and popularized it in the west one of the earliest pioneering works in information systems modeling has been done by young and kent 1958 who argued since we may be called upon to evaluate different computers or to find alternative ways of organizing current systems it is necessary to have some means of precisely stating a data processing problem independently of mechanization they aimed for a precise and abstract way of specifying the informational and time characteristics of a data processing problem and wanted to create a notation that should enable the analyst to organize the problem around any piece of hardware their efforts was not so much focussed on independent systems analysis but on creating abstract specification and invariant basis for designing different alternative implementations using different hardware components a next step in is modeling was taken by codasyl an it industry consortium formed in 1959 who essentially aimed at the same thing as young and kent the development of a proper structure for machine independent problem definition language at the system level of data processing this led to the development of a specific is information algebra types of systems modeling in business and it development systems are modeled with different scopes and scales of complexity such as functional modeling systems architecture business process modeling enterprise modeling further more like systems thinking systems modeling in can be divided into systems analysis hard systems modeling or operational research modeling soft system modeling and all other specific types of systems modeling such as form example

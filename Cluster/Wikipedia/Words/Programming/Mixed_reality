mixed reality for windows mixed reality see windows mixed reality for the gin blossoms album see mixed reality mixed reality mr sometimes referred to as hybrid reality virtual reality vr versus augmented reality ar versus mixed reality mr the definitions in the modern contemporary economy makes the distinction between vr ar and mr very clear virtual reality vr immerses users in a fully artificial digital environment augmented reality ar overlays virtual objects on the realworld environment mixed reality mr not just overlays but anchors virtual objects to the real world and allows the user to interact with the virtual objects an example mixed reality virtual characters mixed into a live video stream of the real world definition virtuality continuum and mediality continuum in 1994 paul milgram and fumio kishino defined a mixed reality as anywhere between the extrema of the virtuality continuum vc mixed reality 1992 us air force laboratory l rosenberg the continuum of mixed reality is one of the two axes in steve manns concept of mediated reality as implemented by various welding helmets and wearable computers and wearable photographic systems he created in the 1970s and early 1980s the conventionally held view of a virtual reality vr environment is one in which the participantobserver is totally immersed in and able to interact with a completely synthetic world such a world may mimic the properties of some realworld environments either existing or fictional however it can also exceed the bounds of physical reality by creating a world in which the physical laws ordinarily governing space time mechanics material properties etc no longer hold what may be overlooked in this view however is that the vr label is also frequently used in association with a variety of other environments to which total immersion and complete synthesis do not necessarily pertain but which fall somewhere along a virtuality continuum in this paper we focus on a particular subclass of vr related technologies that involve the merging of real and virtual worlds which we refer to generically as mixed reality mr realityvirtuality continuum virtuality axis lefttoright and mediality axis bottom to top of the mediated reality continuum here four example points are shown augmented reality augmented virtuality mediated reality and mediated virtuality on the virtuality and mediality axes this includes for example diminished reality eg computerized welding helmets that filter out and diminish certain parts of a scene interreality physics in a physics context the term interreality system describes an interreality system comprising a real physical pendulum coupled to a pendulum that only exists in virtual reality this system apparently has two stable states of motion a dual reality state in which the motion of the two pendula are uncorrelated and a mixed reality state in which the pendula exhibit stable phaselocked motion which is highly correlated the use of the terms mixed reality and interreality in the context of physics is clearly defined but may be slightly different in other fields augmented virtuality someone in a virtual environment seen with a camera acting as a third person point of view augmented virtuality av is a subcategory of mixed reality which refers to the merging of real world objects into virtual worlds as an intermediate case in the virtuality continuum it refers to predominantly virtual spaces where physical elements eg physical objects or people are dynamically integrated into and can interact with the virtual world in real time this integration is achieved with the use of various techniques often streaming video from physical spaces eg via webcam the use of realworld sensor information eg gyroscopes to control a virtual environment is an additional form of augmented virtuality in which external inputs provide context for the virtual view applications a topic of much research mr has found its way into a number of applications evident in the arts and entertainment industries however mr is also branching out into the business manufacturing and education worlds with systems such as these ipcm interactive product content management moving from static product catalogs to interactive 3d smart digital replicas solution consists of application software products with scalable license model sbl simulation based

scalable licensed curriculum development model military training combat reality is simulated and represented in complex layered data through hmd one of the possible applications mixed realities is for training military soldiers training solutions are often built on commercial off the shelf cots technologies examples of technologies used by the army are virtual battlespace 3 and virtra as of 2018 the virtra technology is being purchased by both the civilian and military law enforcement to train personnel in a variety of scenarios these scenarios include active shooter domestic violence military traffic stops etc as of 2017 the us army was developing the synthetic training environment ste ste is a collection of technologies for training purposes that has been estimated to include mixed reality as of 2018 ste was still in development without a projected completion date some recorded goals of the simulation were to increase simulation training capabilities and the availability of the environment to other systems and to enhance realism real asset virtualization environment rave 3d models of manufacturing assets for example process manufacturing machinery are incorporated into a virtual environment and then linked to realtime data associated with that asset avatars allow for multidisciplinary collaboration and decision making based on the data presented in the virtual environment this example of mixed reality was pioneered and demonstrated by kevyn renner of chevron corporation for which a united states patent 8589809 b2 methods and systems for conducting a meeting in a virtual environment was granted november 19 2013 one of the earliest patents describing mixed reality is shown by michael deluca in united states patent 6064354 stereoscopic user interface method and apparatus granted may 16 2000 remote working mixed reality allows a global workforce of remote teams to work together and tackle an organizations business challenges no matter where they are physically located an employee can strap on their headset and noisecanceling headphones and enter a collaborative immersive virtual environment language barriers will become irrelevant as ar applications are able to accurately translate in real time it also means a more flexible workforce while many employers still use inflexible models of fixed working time and location there is evidence that employees are more productive if they have greater autonomy over where when and how they work some employees prefer loud work spaces others need silence some work best in the morning others at night employees also benefit from autonomy in how they work because everyone processes information differently the classic vak model for learning styles differentiates visual auditory and kinesthetic learners machine maintenance is also a subject that can be executed with the help of mixed reality larger companies that have multiple manufacturing locations with a lot of machinery can use mixed reality to educate and instruct their employee the machines need regular checkups and have to be adjusted every now and then these adjustments are mostly done by humans so these employees need to be informed about every small adjustment that needs to be done by using mixed reality employees from multiple locations can put on a headset and get live instructions about the changes instructors can operate the representation that every employee sees and can glide through the production area zooming in to technical details and explain every change of a machine it has shown that a fiveminute training session with such a mixed reality program has the same results as the employees reading a 50page training manual healthcare surgical and ultrasound simulations are used as a training exercise for healthcare professionals medical mannequins are brought to life to generate unlimited training scenarios and teach empathy to healthcare professionals aviation virtual models are used to allowed scientists and engineers to interact with a possible future creation before it touches the factory floor these models provide the opportunity to gain an intuitive understanding of the exact product including real size and constructions details that allow a closer inspection of interior parts these virtual models are also used to find hidden problems and reduce time and money functional mockup mixed reality is applied in the industrial field in order to build mockups that combine physical and digital elements by making use of mixed reality organizations can make use of rapid prototyping or early trial and test methods since designers are able to preview prototype designs at scale and reconstruct these previewed 3d models this form of rapid prototyping will probably lead to an increase of quality in products relatively lower rd costs and improved efficiency architecture architecture firms can use mixed reality to project virtual representations of buildings they are working on over the real world with applications like sketchup viewer there are already some applications that let consumers redesign their own homes by making a 3d scan of the room the consumers can then within that application relocate doors or windows and add all kinds of virtual furniture to the reallife room consciousness it has been hypothesised that a hybrid of mixed and virtual reality could pave the way for human consciousness to be transferred into digital form entirely a concept known as virternity which would leverage blockchain to create its main platform display technologies here are some more

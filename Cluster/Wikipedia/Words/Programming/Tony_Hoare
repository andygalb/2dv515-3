tony hoare for the bicycle racer see tony hoar sir charles antony richard hoare frs freng education and early life born in colombo ceylon now sri lanka to british parents tony hoares father was a colonial civil servant and his mother was the daughter of a tea planter hoare was educated in england at the dragon school in oxford and the kings school in canterbury research and career in 1960 hoare left the soviet union and began working at elliott brothers ltd hoares most significant work has been in the following areas his sorting and selection algorithm quicksort and quickselect hoare logic the formal language communicating sequential processes csp used to specify the interactions between concurrent processes structuring computer operating systems using the monitor concept and the axiomatic specification of programming languages apologies and retractions speaking at a software conference called qcon london in 2009 he apologised for inventing the null reference mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0i call it my billiondollar mistake it was the invention of the null reference in 1965 at that time i was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language algol w my goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe with checking performed automatically by the compiler but i couldnt resist the temptation to put in a null reference simply because it was so easy to implement this has led to innumerable errors vulnerabilities and system crashes which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years for many years under his leadership his oxford department worked on formal specification languages such as csp and z these did not achieve the expected takeup by industry and in 1995 hoare was led to reflect upon the original assumptions ten years ago researchers into formal methods and i was the most mistaken among them predicted that the programming world would embrace with gratitude every assistance promised by formalisation to solve the problems of reliability that arise when programs get large and more safetycritical programs have now got very large and very critical well beyond the scale which can be comfortably tackled by formal methods there have been many problems and failures but these have nearly always been attributable to inadequate analysis of requirements or inadequate management control it has turned out that the world just does not suffer significantly from the kind of problem that our research was originally intended to solve books oj dahl e w dijkstra and c a r hoare 1972 structured programming

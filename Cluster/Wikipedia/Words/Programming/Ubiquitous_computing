ubiquitous computing ubiquitous computing or ubicomp is a concept in software engineering and computer science where computing is made to appear anytime and everywhere in contrast to desktop computing ubiquitous computing can occur using any device in any location and in any format a user interacts with the computer which can exist in many different forms including laptop computers tablets and terminals in everyday objects such as a refrigerator or a pair of glasses the underlying technologies to support ubiquitous computing include internet advanced middleware operating system mobile code sensors microprocessors new io and user interfaces networks mobile protocols location and positioning and new materials this paradigm is also described as pervasive computing and things that think rather than propose a single definition for ubiquitous computing and for these related terms a taxonomy of properties for ubiquitous computing has been proposed from which different kinds or flavors of ubiquitous systems and applications can be described ubiquitous computing touches on a wide range of research topics including distributed computing mobile computing location computing mobile networking contextaware computing sensor networks humancomputer interaction and artificial intelligence core concepts at their core all models of ubiquitous computing share a vision of small inexpensive robust networked processing devices distributed at all scales throughout everyday life and generally turned to distinctly commonplace ends for example a domestic ubiquitous computing environment might interconnect lighting and environmental controls with personal biometric monitors woven into clothing so that illumination and heating conditions in a room might be modulated continuously and imperceptibly another common scenario posits refrigerators aware of their suitably tagged contents able to both plan a variety of menus from the food actually on hand and warn users of stale or spoiled food ubiquitous computing presents challenges across computer science in systems design and engineering in systems modelling and in user interface design contemporary humancomputer interaction models whether commandline menudriven or guibased are inappropriate and inadequate to the ubiquitous case this suggests that the natural interaction paradigm appropriate to a fully robust ubiquitous computing has yet to emerge although there is also recognition in the field that in many ways we are already living in a ubicomp world see also the main article on natural user interfaces contemporary devices that lend some support to this latter idea include mobile phones digital audio players radiofrequency identification tags gps and interactive whiteboards mark weiser proposed three basic forms for ubiquitous system devices see also smart device tabs pads and boards tabs wearable centimetre sized devices pads handheld decimetresized devices boards metre sized interactive display devices these three forms proposed by weiser are characterized by being macrosized having a planar form and on incorporating visual output displays if we relax each of these three characteristics we can expand this range into a much more diverse and potentially more useful range of ubiquitous computing devices hence three additional forms for ubiquitous systems have been proposed dust miniaturized devices can be without visual output displays eg micro electromechanical systems mems ranging from nanometres through micrometers to millimetres see also smart dust skin fabrics based upon light emitting and conductive polymers organic computer devices can be formed into more flexible nonplanar display surfaces and products such as clothes and curtains see oled display mems device can also be painted onto various surfaces so that a variety of physical world structures can act as networked surfaces of mems clay ensembles of mems can be formed into arbitrary three dimensional shapes as artefacts resembling many different kinds of physical object see also tangible interface in his book the rise of the network society manuel castells suggests that there is an ongoing shift from alreadydecentralised standalone microcomputers and mainframes towards entirely pervasive computing in his model of a pervasive computing system castells uses the example of the internet as the start of a pervasive computing system the logical progression from that paradigm is a system where that networking logic becomes applicable in every realm of daily activity in every location and every context castells envisages a system where billions of miniature ubiquitous intercommunication devices will be spread worldwide like pigment in the wall paint ubiquitous computing may be seen to consist of many layers each with their own roles which together form a single system layer 1 task management layer monitors user task context and index map users task to need for the services in the environment to manage complex dependencies layer 2 environment management layer to monitor a resource and its capabilities to map service need user level states of specific capabilities layer 3 environment layer to monitor a relevant resource to manage reliability of the resources history mark weiser coined the phrase ubiquitous computing around 1988 during his tenure as chief technologist of the xerox palo alto research center parc both alone and with parc director and chief scientist john seely brown weiser wrote some of the earliest papers on the subject largely defining it and sketching out its major concerns recognizing the effects of extending processing power recognizing that the extension of processing power into everyday scenarios would necessitate understandings of social cultural and psychological phenomena beyond its proper ambit weiser was influenced by many fields outside computer science including philosophy phenomenology anthropology psychology postmodernism sociology of science and feminist criticism he was explicit about the humanistic origins of the invisible ideal in postmodernist thought referencing as well the ironically dystopian philip k dick novel ubik andy hopper from cambridge university uk proposed and demonstrated the concept of teleporting where applications follow the user wherever heshe moves roy want while a researcher and student working under andy hopper at cambridge university worked on the active badge system which is an advanced location computing system where personal mobility that is merged with computing bill schilit now at google also did some earlier work in this topic and participated in the early mobile computing workshop held in santa cruz in 1996 ken sakamura of the university of tokyo japan leads the ubiquitous networking laboratory unl tokyo as well as the tengine forum the joint goal of sakamuras ubiquitous networking specification and the tengine forum is to enable any everyday device to broadcast and receive information mit has also contributed significant research in this field notably things that think consortium directed by hiroshi ishii joseph a paradiso and rosalind picard at the media lab examples one of the earliest ubiquitous systems was artist natalie jeremijenkos live wire also known as dangling string installed at xerox parc during mark weisers time there this was a piece of string attached to a stepper motor and controlled by a lan connection network activity caused the string to twitch yielding a peripherally noticeable indication of traffic weiser called this an example of calm technology a present manifestation of this trend is the widespread diffusion of mobile phones many of mobile phones supporting high speed data transmission video services and mobile devices with powerful computational ability although these mobile devices are not necessarily manifestations of ubiquitous computing there are examples such as japans yaoyorozu eight million gods project in which mobile devices coupled with radio frequency identification tags demonstrate that ubiquitous computing is already present in some form ambient devices has produced an orb a dashboard and a weather beacon these decorative devices receive data from a wireless network and report current events such as stock prices and the weather like the nabaztag produced by violet snowden the australian futurist mark pesce has produced a highly configurable 52led lamp enabled lamp which uses wifi named moorescloud after moores law the unified computer intelligence corporation has launched a device called ubi the ubiquitous computer that is designed to allow voice interaction with the home and provide constant access to information ubiquitous computing research has focused on building an environment in which computers allow humans to focus attention on select aspects of the environment and operate in supervisory and policymaking roles ubiquitous computing emphasizes the creation of a human computer interface that can interpret and support a users intentions for example mits project oxygen seeks to create a system in which computation is as pervasive as air in the future computation will be human centered it will be freely available everywhere like batteries and power sockets or oxygen in the air we breathewe will not need to carry our own devices around with us instead configurable generic devices either handheld or embedded in the environment will bring computation to us whenever we need it and wherever we might be as we interact with these anonymous devices they will adopt our information personalities they will respect our desires for privacy and security we wont have to type click or learn new computer jargon instead well communicate naturally using speech and gestures that describe our intent this is a fundamental transition that does not seek to escape the physical world and enter some metallic gigabyteinfested cyberspace but rather brings computers and communications to us making them synonymous with the useful tasks they perform network robots link ubiquitous networks with robots contributing to the creation of new lifestyles and solutions to address a variety of social problems including the aging of population and nursing care issues privacy is easily the most oftencited criticism of ubiquitous computing ubicomp and may be the greatest barrier to its longterm success an article by linda little and pam briggs on this privacy issue states that these are the kinds of privacy principles that have been established by the industry but over the past two years we have been trying to understand whether such principles reflect the concerns of the ordinary citizen some of the key research questions we have been addressing are what are users key concerns regarding privacy management in a ubiquitous context and do they reflect expert privacy principles do these concerns vary as a function of context will users have enough confidence in privacy management procedures to handover management and administration of their privacy preferences motahari et al 2007 argue people do not have a complete understanding of the threats to their privacy while users of ubicomp systems are aware of inappropriate use of their personal information legal obligations and inadequate security they are less aware of setting preferences for who has access and any social inferences that can be made by observations by other people they further argue a holistic approach is needed as traditional approaches and current investigations are not enough to address privacy threats in ubiquitous computing recognising in line with a number of other researchers harper singleton 2001 paine et al 2007 that privacy concerns are likely to be highly situationdependent we have developed a method of enquiry which displays a rich context to the user in order to elicit more detailed information about those privacy factors that underpin our acceptance of ubiquitous computing public policy problems are often preceded by long shadows long trains of activity emerging slowly over decades or even the course of a century there is a need for a longterm view to guide policy decision making as this will assist in identifying longterm problems or opportunities related to the ubiquitous computing environment this information can reduce uncertainty and guide the decisions of both policy makers and those directly involved in system development wedemeyer et al 2001 one important consideration is the degree to which different opinions form around a single problem some issues may have strong consensus about their importance even if there are great differences in opinion regarding the cause or solution for example few people will differ in their assessment of a highly tangible problem with physical impact such as terrorists using new weapons of mass destruction to destroy human life the problem statements outlined above that address the future evolution of the human species or challenges to identity have clear cultural or religious implications and are likely to have greater variance in

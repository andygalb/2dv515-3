kent beck beck speaking in 2001 kent beck born 1961 is an american software engineer and the creator of extreme programming the founding document for agile software development extreme and agile methods are closely associated with testdriven development tdd of which beck is perhaps the leading proponent beck pioneered software design patterns as well as the commercial application of smalltalk he wrote the sunit unit testing framework for smalltalk which spawned the xunit series of frameworks notably junit for java which beck wrote with erich gamma beck popularized crc cards with ward cunningham the inventor of the wiki he lives in san francisco california and worked at social media company facebook history beck attended the university of oregon between 1979 and 1987 receiving bs and ms degrees in computer and information science in 1996 beck was hired to work on the chrysler comprehensive compensation system beck in turn brought in ron jeffries in march 1996 the development team estimated the system would be ready to go into production around one year later in 1997 the development team adopted a way of working which is now formalized as extreme programming the oneyear delivery target was nearly achieved with actual delivery being only a couple of months late publications books 1996 kent becks guide to better smalltalk a sorted collection cambridge university press

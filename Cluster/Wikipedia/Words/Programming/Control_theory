control theory this article is about control theory in engineering for control theory in linguistics see control linguistics for control theory in psychology and sociology see control theory sociology and perceptual control theory control theory in control systems engineering is a subfield of mathematics that deals with the control of continuously operating dynamical systems in engineered processes and machines the objective is to develop a control model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without delay or overshoot and ensuring control stability to do this a controller with the requisite corrective behaviour is required this controller monitors the controlled process variable pv and compares it with the reference or set point sp the difference between actual and desired value of the process variable called the error signal or sppv error is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point other aspects which are also studied are controllability and observability on this is based the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing aircraft communications and other industries this is feedback control which is usually continuous and involves taking measurements using a sensor and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range by means of a final control element such as a control valve extensive use is usually made of a diagrammatic style known as the block diagram in it the transfer function also known as the system function or network function is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the differential equations describing the system control theory dates from the 19th century when the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by james clerk maxwell although a major application of control theory is in control systems engineering which deals with the design of process control systems for industry other applications range far beyond this as the general theory of feedback systems control theory is useful wherever feedback occurs history centrifugal governor in a boulton watt engine of 1788 although control systems of various types date back to antiquity a more formal analysis of the field began with a dynamics analysis of the centrifugal governor conducted by the physicist james clerk maxwell in 1868 entitled on governors a notable application of dynamic control was in the area of manned flight the wright brothers made their first successful test flights on december 17 1903 and were distinguished by their ability to control their flights for substantial periods more so than the ability to produce lift from an airfoil which was known continuous reliable control of the airplane was necessary for flights lasting longer than a few seconds by world war ii control theory was becoming an important area of research irmgard flggelotz developed the theory of discontinuous automatic control systems and applied the bangbang principle to the development of automatic flight control equipment for aircraft other areas of application for discontinuous controls included firecontrol systems guidance systems and electronics a centrifugal governor is used to regulate the windmill velocity sometimes mechanical methods are used to improve the stability of systems for example ship stabilizers are fins mounted beneath the waterline and emerging laterally in contemporary vessels they may be gyroscopically controlled active fins which have the capacity to change their angle of attack to counteract roll caused by wind or waves acting on the ship the space race also depended on accurate spacecraft control and control theory has also seen an increasing use in fields such as economics openloop and closedloop feedback control a block diagram of a negative feedback control system using a feedback loop to control the process variable by comparing it with a desired value and applying the difference as an error signal to generate a control output to reduce or eliminate the error example of a single industrial control loop showing continuously modulated control of process flow fundamentally there are two types of control loops open loop control and closed loop feedback control in open loop control the control action from the controller is independent of the process output or controlled process variable pv a good example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer so that heat is applied for a constant time regardless of the temperature of the building the control action is the timed switching onoff of the boiler the process variable is the building temperature but neither is linked in closed loop control the control action from the controller is dependent on feedback from the process in the form of the value of the process variable pv in the case of the boiler analogy a closed loop would include a thermostat to compare the building temperature pv with the temperature set on the thermostat the set point sp this generates a controller output to maintain the building at the desired temperature by switching the boiler on and off a closed loop controller therefore has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to manipulate the process variable to be the same as the reference input or set point for this reason closed loop controllers are also called feedback controllers the definition of a closed loop control system according to the british standard institution is a control system possessing monitoring feedback the deviation signal formed as a result of this feedback being used to control the action of a final control element in such a way as to tend to reduce the deviation to zero likewise a feedback control system is a system which tends to maintain a prescribed relationship of one system variable to another by comparing functions of these variables and using the difference as a means of control other examples an example of a control system is a cars cruise control which is a device designed to maintain vehicle speed at a constant desired or reference speed provided by the driver the controller is the cruise control the plant is the car and the system is the car and the cruise control the system output is the cars speed and the control itself is the engines throttle position which determines how much power the engine delivers a primitive way to implement cruise control is simply to lock the throttle position when the driver engages cruise control however if the cruise control is engaged on a stretch of flat road then the car will travel slower going uphill and faster when going downhill this type of controller is called an openloop controller because there is no feedback no measurement of the system output the cars speed is used to alter the control the throttle position as a result the controller cannot compensate for changes acting on the car like a change in the slope of the road in a closedloop control system data from a sensor monitoring the cars speed the system output enters a controller which continuously compares the quantity representing the speed with the reference quantity representing the desired speed the difference called the error determines the throttle position the control the result is to match the cars speed to the reference speed maintain the desired system output now when the car goes uphill the difference between the input the sensed speed and the reference continuously determines the throttle position as the sensed speed drops below the reference the difference increases the throttle opens and engine power increases speeding up the vehicle in this way the controller dynamically counteracts changes to the cars speed the central idea of these control systems is the feedback loop the controller affects the system output which in turn is measured and fed back to the controller classical control theory classical control theory to overcome the limitations of the openloop controller control theory introduces feedback a closedloop controller uses feedback to control states or outputs of a dynamical system its name comes from the information path in the system process inputs eg voltage applied to an electric motor have an effect on the process outputs eg speed or torque of the motor which is measured with sensors and processed by the controller the result the control signal is fed back as input to the process closing the loop closedloop controllers have the following advantages over openloop controllers disturbance rejection such as hills in the cruise control example above guaranteed performance even with model uncertainties when the model structure does not match perfectly the real process and the model parameters are not exact unstable processes can be stabilized reduced sensitivity to parameter variations improved reference tracking performance in some systems closedloop and openloop control are used simultaneously in such systems the openloop control is termed feedforward and serves to further improve reference tracking performance a common closedloop controller architecture is the pid controller closedloop transfer function further information closedloop transfer function the output of the system yt is fed back through a sensor measurement f to a comparison with the reference value rt the controller c then takes the error e difference between the reference and the output to change the inputs u to the system under control p this is shown in the figure this kind of controller is a closedloop controller or feedback controller this is called a singleinputsingleoutput siso control system mimo ie multiinputmultioutput systems with more than one inputoutput are common in such cases variables are represented through vectors instead of simple scalar values for some distributed parameter systems the vectors may be infinitedimensional typically functions if we assume the controller c the plant p and the sensor f are linear and timeinvariant ie elements of their transfer function cs ps and fs do not depend on time the systems above can be analysed using the laplace transform on the variables this gives the following relations y s p s u s displaystyle yspsus u

expression h s p s c s 1 f s p s c s displaystyle hsfrac pscs1fspscs is referred to as the closedloop transfer function of the system the numerator is the forward openloop gain from r to y and the denominator is one plus the gain in going around the feedback loop the socalled loop gain if p s c s 1 displaystyle pscsgg 1 ie it has a large norm with each value of s and if f s 1 displaystyle fsapprox 1 then ys is approximately equal to rs and the output closely tracks the reference input pid feedback control pid controller a block diagram of a pid controller in a feedback loop rt is the desired process value or set point and yt is the measured process value a proportionalintegralderivative controller pid controller is a control loop feedback mechanism control technique widely used in control systems a pid controller continuously calculates an error value e t displaystyle et as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable and applies a correction based on proportional integral and derivative terms pid is an initialism for proportionalintegralderivative referring to the three terms operating on the error signal to produce a control signal the theoretical understanding and application dates from the 1920s and they are implemented in nearly all analogue control systems originally in mechanical controllers and then using discrete electronics and latterly in industrial process computers the pid controller is probably the mostused feedback control design if ut is the control signal sent to the system yt is the measured output and rt is the desired output and e t r t y t displaystyle etrtyt is the tracking error a pid controller has the general form u t k p e t k i e d k d det d t displaystyle utkpetkiint etau textdtau kdfrac textdettextdt the desired closed loop dynamics is obtained by adjusting the three parameters k p displaystyle kp k i displaystyle ki and k d displaystyle kd often iteratively by tuning and without specific knowledge of a plant model stability can often be ensured using only the proportional term the integral term permits the rejection of a step disturbance often a striking specification in process control the derivative term is used to provide damping or shaping of the response pid controllers are the most wellestablished class of control systems however they cannot be used in several more complicated cases especially if mimo systems are considered applying laplace transformation results in the transformed pid controller equation u s k p e s k i 1 s e s k d s e s displaystyle

physically realizable nor desirable due to amplification of noise and resonant modes in the system therefore a phaselead compensator type approach or a differentiator with lowpass rolloff are used instead linear and nonlinear control theory the field of control theory can be divided into two branches linear control theory this applies to systems made of devices which obey the superposition principle which means roughly that the output is proportional to the input they are governed by linear differential equations a major subclass is systems which in addition have parameters which do not change with time called linear time invariant lti systems these systems are amenable to powerful frequency domain mathematical techniques of great generality such as the laplace transform fourier transform z transform bode plot root locus and nyquist stability criterion these lead to a description of the system using terms like bandwidth frequency response eigenvalues gain resonant frequencies zeros and poles which give solutions for system response and design techniques for most systems of interest nonlinear control theory this covers a wider class of systems that do not obey the superposition principle and applies to more realworld systems because all real control systems are nonlinear these systems are often governed by nonlinear differential equations the few mathematical techniques which have been developed to handle them are more difficult and much less general often applying only to narrow categories of systems these include limit cycle theory poincar maps lyapunov stability theorem and describing functions nonlinear systems are often analyzed using numerical methods on computers for example by simulating their operation using a simulation language if only solutions near a stable point are of interest nonlinear systems can often be linearized by approximating them by a linear system using perturbation theory and linear techniques can be used analysis techniques frequency domain and time domain mathematical techniques for analyzing and designing control systems fall into two different categories frequency domain in this type the values of the state variables the mathematical variables representing the systems input output and feedback are represented as functions of frequency the input signal and the systems transfer function are converted from time functions to functions of frequency by a transform such as the fourier transform laplace transform or z transform the advantage of this technique is that it results in a simplification of the mathematics the differential equations that represent the system are replaced by algebraic equations in the frequency domain which is much simpler to solve however frequency domain techniques can only be used with linear systems as mentioned above timedomain state space representation in this type the values of the state variables are represented as functions of time with this model the system being analyzed is represented by one or more differential equations since frequency domain techniques are limited to linear systems time domain is widely used to analyze realworld nonlinear systems although these are more difficult to solve modern computer simulation techniques such as simulation languages have made their analysis routine in contrast to the frequency domain analysis of the classical control theory modern control theory utilizes the timedomain state space representation a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input output and state variables related by firstorder differential equations to abstract from the number of inputs outputs and states the variables are expressed as vectors and the differential and algebraic equations are written in matrix form the latter only being possible when the dynamical system is linear the state space representation also known as the timedomain approach provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs with inputs and outputs we would otherwise have to write down laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system unlike the frequency domain approach the use of the statespace representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions state space refers to the space whose axes are the state variables the state of the system can be represented as a point within that space system interfacing siso mimo control systems can be divided into different categories depending on the number of inputs and outputs singleinput singleoutput siso this is the simplest and most common type in which one output is controlled by one control signal examples are the cruise control example above or an audio system in which the control input is the input audio signal and the output is the sound waves from the speaker multipleinput multipleoutput mimo these are found in more complicated systems for example modern large telescopes such as the keck and mmt have mirrors composed of many separate segments each controlled by an actuator the shape of the entire mirror is constantly adjusted by a mimo active optics control system using input from multiple sensors at the focal plane to compensate for changes in the mirror shape due to thermal expansion contraction stresses as it is rotated and distortion of the wavefront due to turbulence in the atmosphere complicated systems such as nuclear reactors and human cells are simulated by a computer as large mimo control systems topics in control theory stability the stability of a general dynamical system with no input can be described with lyapunov stability criteria a linear system is called boundedinput boundedoutput bibo stable if its output will stay bounded for any bounded input stability for nonlinear systems that take an input is inputtostate stability iss which combines lyapunov stability and a notion similar to bibo stability for simplicity the following descriptions focus on continuoustime and discretetime linear systems mathematically this means that for a causal linear system to be stable all of the poles of its transfer function must have negativereal values ie the real part of each pole must be less than zero practically speaking stability requires that the transfer function complex poles reside in the open left half of the complex plane for continuous time when the laplace transform is used to obtain the transfer function inside the unit circle for discrete time when the ztransform is used the difference between the two cases is simply due to the traditional method of plotting continuous time versus discrete time transfer functions the continuous laplace transform is in cartesian coordinates where the x displaystyle x axis is the real axis and the discrete ztransform is in circular coordinates where the displaystyle rho axis is the real axis when the appropriate conditions above are satisfied a system is said to be asymptotically stable the variables of an asymptotically stable control system always decrease from their initial value and do not show permanent oscillations permanent oscillations occur when a pole has a real part exactly equal to zero in the continuous time case or a modulus equal to one in the discrete time case if a simply stable system response neither decays nor grows over time and has no oscillations it is marginally stable in this case the system transfer function has nonrepeated poles at the complex plane origin ie their real and complex component is zero in the continuous time case oscillations are present when poles with real part equal to zero have an imaginary part not equal to zero if a system in question has an impulse response of x n 05 n u n displaystyle x then the ztransform see this example is given by x z 1 1 05 z 1 displaystyle xzfrac 1105z1 which has a pole in z 05 displaystyle z05 zero imaginary part this system is bibo asymptotically stable since the pole is inside the unit circle however if the impulse response was x n 15 n u n displaystyle x then the ztransform is x z 1 1 15 z 1 displaystyle xzfrac 1115z1 which has a pole at z 15 displaystyle z15 and is not bibo stable since the pole has a modulus strictly greater than one numerous tools exist for the analysis of the poles of a system these include graphical systems like the root locus bode plots or the nyquist plots mechanical changes can make equipment and control systems more stable sailors add ballast to improve the stability of ships cruise ships use antiroll fins that extend transversely from the side of the ship for perhaps 30 feet 10 m and are continuously rotated about their axes to develop forces that oppose the roll controllability and observability controllability and observability controllability and observability are main issues in the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal if a state is not controllable then no signal will ever be able to control the state if a state is not controllable but its dynamics are stable then the state is termed stabilizable observability instead is related to the possibility of observing through output measurements the state of a system if a state is not observable the controller will never be able to determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system however similar to the stabilizability condition above if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable from a geometrical point of view looking at the states of each variable of the system to be controlled every bad state of these variables must be controllable and observable to ensure a good behavior in the closedloop system that is if one of the eigenvalues of the system is not both controllable and observable this part of the dynamics will remain untouched in the closedloop system if such an eigenvalue is not stable the dynamics of this eigenvalue will be present in the closedloop system which therefore will be unstable unobservable poles are not present in the transfer function realization of a statespace representation which is why sometimes the latter is preferred in dynamical systems analysis solutions to problems of an uncontrollable or unobservable system include adding actuators and sensors control specification several different control strategies have been devised in the past years these vary from extremely general ones pid controller to others devoted to very particular classes of systems especially robotics or aircraft cruise control a control problem can have several specifications stability of course is always present the controller must ensure that the closedloop system is stable regardless of the openloop stability a poor choice of controller can even worsen the stability of the openloop system which must normally be avoided sometimes it would be desired to obtain particular dynamics in the closed loop ie that the poles have r e displaystyle reoverline lambda where displaystyle overline lambda is a fixed value strictly greater than zero instead of simply asking that r e 0 displaystyle re0 another typical specification is the rejection of a step disturbance including an integrator in the openloop chain ie directly before the system under control easily achieves this other classes of disturbances need different types of subsystems to be included other classical control theory specifications regard the timeresponse of the closedloop system these include the rise time the time needed by the control system to reach the desired value after a perturbation peak overshoot the highest value reached by the response before reaching the desired value and others settling time quarterdecay frequency domain specifications are usually related to robustness see after modern performance assessments use some variation of integrated tracking error iaeisacqi model identification and robustness a control system must always have some robustness property a robust controller is such that its properties do not change much if applied to a system slightly different from the mathematical one used for its synthesis this requirement is important as no real physical system truly behaves like the series of differential equations used to represent it mathematically typically a simpler mathematical model is chosen in order to simplify calculations otherwise the true system dynamics can be so complicated that a complete model is impossible system identification further information system identification the process of determining the equations that govern the models dynamics is called system identification this can be done offline for example executing a series of measures from which to calculate an approximated mathematical model typically its transfer function or matrix such identification from the output however cannot take account of unobservable dynamics sometimes the model is built directly starting from known physical equations for example in the case of a massspringdamper system we know that m x t k x t b x t displaystyle mddot xtkxtmathrm b dot xt even assuming that a complete model is used in designing the controller all the parameters included in these equations called nominal parameters are never known with absolute precision the control system will have to behave correctly even when connected to a physical system with true parameter values away from nominal some advanced control techniques include an online identification process see later the parameters of the model are calculated identified while the controller itself is running in this way if a drastic variation of the parameters ensues for example if the robots arm releases a weight the controller will adjust itself consequently in order to ensure the correct performance analysis analysis of the robustness of a siso single input single output control system can be performed in the frequency domain considering the systems transfer function and using nyquist and bode diagrams topics include gain and phase margin and amplitude margin for mimo multiinput multi output and in general more complicated control systems one must consider the theoretical results devised for each control technique see next section ie if particular robustness qualities are needed the engineer must shift his attention to a control technique by including them in its properties constraints a particular robustness issue is the requirement for a control system to perform properly in the presence of input and state constraints in the physical world every signal is limited it could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system for example trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed this can produce undesired behavior of the closedloop system or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems specific control techniques are available to solve the problem model predictive control see later and antiwind up systems the latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the control signal never exceeds a given threshold system classifications linear systems control state space controls for mimo systems pole placement can be performed mathematically using a state space representation of the openloop system and calculating a feedback matrix assigning poles in the desired positions in complicated systems this can require computerassisted calculation capabilities and cannot always ensure robustness furthermore all system states are not in general measured and so observers must be included and incorporated in pole placement design nonlinear systems control nonlinear control processes in industries like robotics and the aerospace industry typically have strong nonlinear dynamics in control theory it is sometimes possible to linearize such classes of systems and apply linear techniques but in many cases it can be necessary to devise from scratch theories permitting control of nonlinear systems these eg feedback linearization backstepping sliding mode control trajectory linearization control normally take advantage of results based on lyapunovs theory differential geometry has been widely used as a tool for generalizing wellknown linear control concepts to the nonlinear case as well as showing the subtleties that make it a more challenging problem control theory has also been used to decipher the neural mechanism that directs cognitive states decentralized systems control distributed control system when the system is controlled by multiple controllers the problem is one of decentralized control decentralization is helpful in many ways for instance it helps control systems to operate over a larger geographical area the agents in decentralized control systems can interact using communication channels and coordinate their actions deterministic and stochastic systems control stochastic control a stochastic control problem is one in which the evolution of the state variables is subjected to random shocks from outside the system a deterministic control problem is not subject to external random shocks main control strategies every control system must guarantee first the stability of the closedloop behavior for linear systems this can be obtained by directly placing the poles nonlinear control systems use specific theories normally based on aleksandr lyapunovs theory to ensure stability without regard to the inner dynamics of the system the possibility to fulfill different specifications varies from the model considered and the control strategy chosen list of the main control techniques adaptive control uses online identification of the process parameters or modification of controller gains thereby obtaining strong robustness properties adaptive controls were applied for the first time in the aerospace industry in the 1950s and have found particular success in that field a hierarchical control system is a type of control system in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchical tree when the links in the tree are implemented by a computer network then that hierarchical control system is also a form of networked control system intelligent control uses various ai computing approaches like artificial neural networks bayesian probability fuzzy logic machine learning evolutionary computation and genetic algorithms to control a dynamic system optimal control is a particular control technique in which the control signal optimizes a certain cost index for example in the case of a satellite the jet thrusts needed to bring it to desired trajectory that consume the least amount of fuel two optimal control design methods have been widely used in industrial applications as it has been shown they can guarantee closedloop stability these are model predictive control mpc and linearquadraticgaussian control lqg the first can more explicitly take into account constraints on the signals in the system which is an important feature in many industrial processes however the optimal control structure in mpc is only a means to achieve such a result as it does not optimize a true performance index of the closedloop control system together with pid controllers mpc systems are the most widely used control technique in process control robust control deals explicitly with uncertainty in its approach to controller design controllers designed using robust control methods tend to be able to cope with small differences between the true system and the nominal model used for design robust methods aim to achieve robust performance andor stability in the presence of small modeling errors stochastic control deals with control design with uncertainty in the model in typical stochastic control problems it is assumed that there exist random noise and disturbances in the model and the controller and the control design must take into account these random deviations energyshaping control view the plant and the controller as energytransformation devices the control strategy is formulated in terms of interconnection in a powerpreserving manner in order to achieve a desired behavior selforganized criticality control may be defined as attempts to interfere in the processes by which the selforganized system dissipates energy people in systems and control people in systems and control many active and historical figures made significant contribution to control theory including pierresimon laplace invented the ztransform in his work on probability theory now used to solve discretetime control theory problems the ztransform is a discretetime equivalent of the laplace transform which is named

ivar jacobson ivar hjalmar jacobson born 1939 is a swedish computer scientist and software engineer known as major contributor to uml objectory rational unified process rup aspectoriented software development and essence biography ivar jacobson was born in ystad sweden on september 2nd 1939 he received his master of electrical engineering degree at chalmers institute of technology in gothenburg in 1962 after his work at ericsson he formalized the language and method he had been working on in his phd at the royal institute of technology in stockholm in 1985 on the thesis language constructs for large real time systems after his masters degree jacobson joined ericsson and worked in rd on computerized switching systems ake and axe including plex after his phd thesis in april 1987 he started objective systems with ericsson as a major customer a majority stake of the company was acquired by ericsson in 1991 and the company was renamed objectory ab jacobson developed the software method objectoriented software engineering oose published 1992 which was a simplified version of the commercial software process objectory short for object factory in october 1995 ericsson divested objectory to rational software and jacobson started working with grady booch and james rumbaugh known collectively as the three amigos when ibm bought rational in 2003 jacobson decided to leave after he stayed on until may 2004 as an executive technical consultant in mid2003 jacobson formed ivar jacobson international iji which operates across three continents with offices in the uk the us sweden switzerland china and singapore work ericsson in 1967 at ericsson jacobson proposed the use of software components in the new generation of software controlled telephone switches ericsson was developing in doing this he invented sequence diagrams and developed collaboration diagrams he also used state transition diagrams to describe the message flows between components jacobson saw a need for blueprints for software development he was one of the original developers of the specification and design language sdl in 1975 sdl became a standard in the telecoms industry at objectory he also invented use cases as a way to specify functional software requirements rational software at rational jacobson and his friends grady booch and james rumbaugh designed the uml and his objectory process evolved to become the rational unified process under the leadership of philippe kruchten essential unified process in november 2005 jacobson announced the essential unified process or essup for short essup was a new practice centric software development process that stood on the shoulders of modern but established software development practices it was a fresh new start integrating successful practices sourced from the three leading process camps the unified process camp the agile software development camp and the process improvement camp each one of them contributed different capabilities structure agility and process improvement ivar has described essup as a super light and agile rup and iji have integrated essup into microsoft visual studio team system and eclipse esswork standing on the experience of essup ivar and his team in particular ian spence and pan wei ng developed esswok starting in 2006 esswork is a framework for working with methods it is based on a kernel of universal elements always prevalent in software development endeavors on top of the kernel some fifteen practices have been defined a team can create their own method by composing practices semat in november 2009 jacobson bertrand meyer and richard soley the troika started an initiative called semat software engineering method and theory to seek to develop a rigorous theoretically sound basis for software engineering practice and its wide adoption by industry and academia semat has been inspired by the work at iji but it is a fresh new start it has resulted in essence which at the time of this writing has been recommended as an omg standard publications jacobson has published several books and articles a selection 1992 objectoriented software engineering a use case driven approach acm press with

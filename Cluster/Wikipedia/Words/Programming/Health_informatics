informaticists transform health care by analyzing designing implementing and evaluating information and communication systems that enhance individual and population health outcomes improve care and strengthen the clinicianpatient relationship clinical informaticians use their knowledge of patient care combined with their understanding of informatics concepts methods and health informatics tools to assess information and knowledge needs of health care professionals patients and their families characterize evaluate and refine clinical processes develop implement and refine clinical decision support systems and lead or participate in the procurement customization development implementation management evaluation and continuous improvement of clinical information systems clinicians collaborate with other health care and information technology professionals to develop health informatics tools which promote patient care that is safe efficient effective timely patientcentered and equitable many clinical informaticists are also computer scientists in october 2011 american board of medical specialties abms the organization overseeing the certification of specialist mds in the united states announced the creation of mdonly physician certification in clinical informatics the first examination for board certification in the subspecialty of clinical informatics was offered in october 2013 by american board of preventive medicine abpm with 432 passing to become the 2014 inaugural class of diplomates in clinical informatics fellowship programs exist for physicians who wish to become boardcertified in clinical informatics physicians must have graduated from a medical school in the united states or canada or a school located elsewhere that is approved by the abpm in addition they must complete a primary residency program such as internal medicine or any of the 24 subspecialties recognized by the abms and be eligible to become licensed to practice medicine in the state where their fellowship program is located the fellowship program is 24 months in length with fellows dividing their time between informatics rotations didactic method research and clinical work in their primary specialty integrated data repository example idr schema achilles tool for data characterization of a healthcare dataset one of the fundamental elements of biomedical and translation research is the use of integrated data repositories a survey conducted in 2010 defined integrated data repository idr as a data warehouse incorporating various sources of clinical data to support queries for a range of researchlike functions another challenge is data quality methods that adjust for bias such as using propensity score matching methods assume that a complete health record is captured tools that examine data quality eg point to missing data help in discovering data quality problems clinical research informatics clinical research informatics cri is a subfield of health informatics that tries to improve the efficiency of clinical research by using informatics methods some of the problems tackled by cri are creation of data warehouses of healthcare data that can be used for research support of data collection in clinical trials by the use of electronic data capture systems streamlining ethical approvals and renewals in us the responsible entity is the local institutional review board maintenance of repositories of past clinical trial data de identified cri is a fairly new branch of informatics and has met growing pains as any up and coming field does some issues cri faces is the ability for the statisticians and the computer system architects to work with the clinical research staff in designing a system and lack of funding to support the development of a new system researchers and the informatics team have a difficult time coordinating plans and ideas in order to design a system that is easy to use for the research team yet fits in the system requirements of the computer team the lack of funding can be a hindrance to the development of the cri many organizations who are performing research are struggling to get financial support to conduct the research much less invest that money in an informatics system that will not provide them any more income or improve the outcome of the research embi 2009 common data elements cdes in clinical research ability to integrate data from multiple clinical trials is an important part of clinical research informatics initiatives such as phenx and patientreported outcomes measurement information system triggered a general effort to improve secondary use of data collected in past human clinical trials cde initiatives for example try to allow clinical trial designers to adopt standardized research instruments electronic case report forms data sharing platforms for clinical study data a parallel effort to standardizing how data is collected are initiatives that offer de identified patient level clinical study data to be downloaded by researchers who wish to reuse this data examples of such platforms are project data sphere informatics issues in data formats for sharing results plain csv files fda endorsed formats such as cdisc study data tabulation model are important challenges within the field of clinical research informatics human bioinformatics translational bioinformatics with the completion of the human genome and the recent advent of high throughput sequencing and genomewide association studies of single nucleotide polymorphic organisms the fields of molecular bioinformatics biostatistics statistical genetics and clinical informatics are converging into the emerging field of translational bioinformatics the relationship between bioinformatics and health informatics while conceptually related under the umbrella of biomedical informatics has not always been very clear the tbi community is specifically motivated with the development of approaches to identify linkages between fundamental biological and clinical information along with complementary areas of emphasis such as those focused on developing systems and approaches within clinical research contexts insights from tbi may enable a new paradigm for the study and treatment of disease translational bioinformatics tbi is a relatively new field that surfaced in the year of 2000 when human genome sequence was released today tbi field is categorized into four major themes that are briefly described below clinical big dataclinical big data is a collection of electronic health records that are used for innovations the evidencebased approach that is currently practiced in medicine is suggested to be merged with the practicebased medicine to achieve better outcomes for patients as ceo of californiabased cognitive computing firm apixio darren schutle explains that the care can be better fitted to the patient if the data could be collected from various medical records merged and analyzed further the combination of similar profiles can serve as a basis for personalized medicine pointing to what works and what does not for certain condition marr 2016 genomics in clinical caregenomic data are used to identify the genes involvement in unknown or rare conditionssyndromes currently the most vigorous area of using genomics is oncology the identification of genomic sequencing of cancer may define reasons of drugs sensitivity and resistance during oncological treatment processes omics for drugs discovery and repurposingrepurposing of the drug is an appealing idea that allows the pharmaceutical companies to sell an already approved drug to treat a different conditiondisease that the drug was not initially approved for by the fda the observation of molecular signatures in disease and compare those to signatures observed in cells points to the possibility of a drug ability to cure andor relieve symptoms of a disease personalized genomic testingin the usa several companies offer directtoconsumer dtc genetic testing the company that performs the majority of testing is called 23andme utilizing genetic testing in health care raises many ethical legal and social concerns one of the main questions is whether the healthcare providers are ready to include patientsupplied genomic information while providing care that is unbiased despite the intimate genomic knowledge and a high quality the documented examples of incorporating such information into a healthcare delivery showed both positive and negative impacts on the overall healthcare related outcomes computational health informatics computational health informatics is a branch of computer science that deals specifically with computational techniques that are relevant in healthcare computational health informatics is also a branch of health informatics but is orthogonal to much of the work going on in health informatics because computer scientists interest is mainly in understanding fundamental properties of computation health informatics on the other hand is primarily concerned with understanding fundamental properties of medicine that allow for the intervention of computers the health domain provides an extremely wide variety of problems that can be tackled using computational techniques and computer scientists are attempting to make a difference in medicine by studying the underlying principles of computer science that will allow for meaningful to medicine algorithms and systems to be developed thus computer scientists working in computational health informatics and health scientists working in medical health informatics combine to develop the next generation of healthcare technologies using computers to analyze health data has been around since the 1950s but it wasnt until the 1990s that the first sturdy models appeared the development of the internet has helped develop computational health informatics over the past decade computer models are used to examine various topics such as how exercise affects obesity healthcare costs and many more examples of projects in computational health informatics include the coach project informatics for education and research in health and medicine clinical research informatics clinical research informatics cri is an amalgamation of clinical and research informatics featuring both clinical and research informatics cri has a vital role in clinical research patient care and the building of healthcare system katzan rudick 2012 cri is one of the rapidly growing subdivisions of biomedical informatics which plays an important role in developing new informatics theories tools and solutions to accelerate the full transitional continuum kahn weng 2012 evolution of cri was extremely important in informatics as there was an extraordinary increase in the scope and pace of clinical and translational science advancements katzan rudick 2012 clinical research informatics takes the core foundations principles and technologies related to health informatics and applies these to clinical research contexts there are a number of activities within clinical research that cri supports including more efficient and effective data collection and acquisition improved recruitment into clinical trials optimal protocol design and efficient management patient recruitment and management adverse event reporting regulatory compliance data storage transfer processing and analysis repositories of data from completed clinical trials for secondary analyses history worldwide use of computer technology in medicine began in the early 1950s with the rise of the computers early names for health informatics included medical computing biomedical computing medical computer science computer medicine medical electronic data processing medical automatic data processing medical information processing medical information science medical software engineering and medical computer technology the health informatics community is still growing it is by no means a mature profession but work in the uk by the voluntary registration body the uk council of health informatics professions has suggested eight key constituencies within the domaininformation management knowledge management portfolioprogramproject management ict education and research clinical informatics health recordsservice and businessrelated health informatics service management these constituencies accommodate professionals in and for the nhs in academia and commercial service and solution providers since the 1970s the most prominent international coordinating body has been the international medical informatics association imia in the united states even though the idea of using computers in medicine emerged as technology advanced in the early 20th century it was not until the 1950s that informatics began to have an effect in the united states the earliest use of electronic digital computers for medicine was for dental projects in the 1950s at the united states national bureau of standards by robert ledley guided by ledleys late 1950s survey of computer use in biology and medicine carried out for the nasnrc and by his and lusteds articles the nih undertook the first major effort to introduce computers to biology and medicine this effort carried out initially by the nihs advisory committee on computers in research accr chaired by lusted spent over 40 million between 1960 and 1964 in order to establish dozens of large and small biomedical research centers in the us one early 1960 nonaccr use of computers was to help quantify normal human movement as a precursor to scientifically measuring deviations from normal and design of prostheses the use of computers ibm 650 1620 and 7040 allowed analysis of a large sample size and of more measurements and subgroups than had been previously practical with mechanical calculators thus allowing an objective understanding of how human locomotion varies by age and body characteristics a study coauthor was dean of the marquette university college of engineering this work led to discrete biomedical engineering departments there and elsewhere the next steps in the mid1960s were the development sponsored largely by the nih of expert systems such as mycin and internisti in 1965 the national library of medicine started to use medline and medlars around this time neil pappalardo curtis marble and robert greenes developed mumps massachusetts general hospital utility multiprogramming system in octo barnetts laboratory of computer science a descendent of this system is being used in the united states veterans affairs hospital system the va has the largest enterprisewide health information system that includes an electronic medical record known as the veterans health information systems and technology architecture vista a graphical user interface known as the computerized patient record system cprs allows health care providers to review and update a patients electronic medical record at any of the vas over 1000 health care facilities during the 1960s morris collen a physician working for kaiser permanentes division of research developed computerized systems to automate many aspects of multiphased health checkups these systems became the basis the larger medical databases kaiser permanente developed during the 1970s and 1980s kaiser permanente in the 1970s a growing number of commercial vendors began to market practice management and electronic medical records systems although many products exist only a small number of health practitioners use fully featured electronic health care records systems in 1970 warner v slack md and howard l bleich md cofounded the academic division of clinical informatics computerized systems involved in patient care have led to a number of changes such changes have led to improvements in electronic health records which are now capable of sharing medical information among multiple healthcare stakeholderszahabi kaber swangnetr 2015 thereby supporting the flow of patient information through various modalities of care computer use today involves a broad ability which includes but isnt limited to physician diagnosis and documentation patient appointment scheduling and billing many researchers in the field have identified an increase in the quality of healthcare systems decreased errors by healthcare workers and lastly savings in time and money zahabi kaber swangnetr 2015 the system however is not perfect and will continue to require improvement frequently cited factors of concern involve usability safety accessibility and userfriendliness zahabi kaber swangnetr 2015 as leaders in the field of medical informatics improve upon the aforementioned factors of concern the overall provision of health care will continue to improve homer r warner one of the fathers of medical informatics founded the department of medical informatics at the university of utah in 1968 the american medical informatics association amia has an award named after him on application of informatics to medicine informatics certifications like other it training specialties there are informatics certifications available to help informatics professionals stand out and be recognized the american nurses credentialing center ancc offers a board certification in nursing informatics certifications are widely requested by employers in health informatics and overall the demand for certified informatics workers in the united states is outstripping supply in 2017 a consortium of health informatics trainers composed of measure evaluation public health foundation india university of pretoria kenyatta university and the

privacy security and confidentiality workflow process improvement technology people and processes process engineering quality process improvement and health information technology computer hardware software databases data warehousing information networks information systems information exchange data analytics and usability methods in the uk the broad history of health informatics has been captured in the book uk health computing recollections and reflections hayes g barnett d eds bcs may 2008 by those active in the field predominantly members of bcs health and its constituent groups the book describes the path taken as early development of health informatics was unorganized and idiosyncratic in the early 1950s it was prompted by those involved in nhs finance and only in the early 1960s did solutions including those in pathology 1960 radiotherapy 1962 immunization 1963 and primary care 1968 emerge many of these solutions even in the early 1970s were developed inhouse by pioneers in the field to meet their own requirements in part this was due to some areas of health services for example the immunization and vaccination of children still being provided by local authorities interesting this is a situation which the coalition government proposes broadly to return to in the 2010 strategy equity and excellence liberating the nhs july 2010 stating we will put patients at the heart of the nhs through an information revolution and greater choice and control with shared decisionmaking becoming the norm no decision about me without me and patients having access to the information they want to make choices about their care they will have increased control over their own care records these types of statements present a significant opportunity for health informaticians to come out of the backoffice and take up a frontline role in supporting clinical practice and the business of care delivery the uk health informatics community has long played a key role in the international activity joining tc4 of the international federation of information processing 1969 which became imia 1979 under the aegis of bcs health cambridge was the host for the first efmi medical informatics europe 1974 conference and london was the location for imias tenth global congress medinfo2001 current state and policy initiatives this article reads like a review rather than an encyclopedic description of the subject please help improve this article to make it neutral in tone and meet wikipedias quality standards august 2009 argentina since 1997 the buenos aires biomedical informatics group a nonprofit group represents the interests of a broad range of clinical and nonclinical professionals working within the health informatics sphere its purposes are promote the implementation of the computer tool in the healthcare activity scientific research health administration and in all areas related to health sciences and biomedical research support promote and disseminate content related activities with the management of health information and tools they used to do under the name of biomedical informatics promote cooperation and exchange of actions generated in the field of biomedical informatics both in the public and private national and international level interact with all scientists recognized academic stimulating the creation of new instances that have the same goal and be inspired by the same purpose to promote organize sponsor and participate in events and activities for training in computer and information and disseminating developments in this area that might be useful for team members and health related activities the argentinian health system is heterogeneous in its function and because of that the informatics developments show a heterogeneous stage many private health care center have developed systems such as the hospital aleman of buenos aires or the hospital italiano de buenos aires that also has a residence program for health informatics brazil brazilian society of health informatics the first applications of computers to medicine and healthcare in brazil started around 1968 with the installation of the first mainframes in public university hospitals and the use of programmable calculators in scientific research applications minicomputers such as the ibm 1130 were installed in several universities and the first applications were developed for them such as the hospital census in the school of medicine of ribeiro preto and patient master files in the hospital das clnicas da universidade de so paulo respectively at the cities of ribeiro preto and so paulo campuses of the university of so paulo in the 1970s several digital corporation and hewlett packard minicomputers were acquired for public and armed forces hospitals and more intensively used for intensivecare unit cardiology diagnostics patient monitoring and other applications in the early 1980s with the arrival of cheaper microcomputers a great upsurge of computer applications in health ensued and in 1986 the brazilian society of health informatics was founded the first brazilian congress of health informatics was held and the first brazilian journal of health informatics was published in brazil two universities are pioneers in teaching and research in medical informatics both the university of sao paulo and the federal university of sao paulo offer undergraduate programs highly qualified in the area as well as extensive graduate programs msc and phd in 2015 the universidade federal de cincias da sade de porto alegre rio grande do sul also started to offer undergraduate program canada health informatics projects in canada are implemented provincially with different provinces creating different systems a national federally funded notforprofit organization called canada health infoway was created in 2001 to foster the development and adoption of electronic health records across canada as of december 31 2008 there were 276 ehr projects under way in canadian hospitals other healthcare facilities pharmacies and laboratories with an investment value of 15billion from canada health infoway provincial and territorial programmes include the following ehealth ontario was created as an ontario provincial government agency in september 2008 it has been plagued by delays and its ceo was fired over a multimilliondollar contracts scandal in 2009 alberta netcare was created in 2003 by the government of alberta today the netcare portal is used daily by thousands of clinicians it provides access to demographic data prescribeddispensed drugs known allergiesintolerances immunizations laboratory test results diagnostic imaging reports the diabetes registry and other medical reports netcare interface capabilities are being included in electronic medical record products which are being funded by the provincial government united states in 2004 president george w bush signed executive order 13335 creating the office of the national coordinator for health information technology onchit as a division of the us department of health and human services hhs the mission of this office is widespread adoption of interoperable electronic health records ehrs in the us within 10 years see quality improvement organizations for more information on federal initiatives in this area in 2014 the department of education approved an advanced health informatics undergraduate program that was submitted by the university of south alabama the program is designed to provide specific health informatics education and is the only program in the country with a health informatics lab the program is housed in the school of computing in shelby hall a recently completed 50 million state of the art teaching facility the university of south alabama awarded david l loeser on may 10 2014 with the first health informatics degree the program currently is scheduled to have 100 students awarded by 2016 the certification commission for healthcare information technology cchit a private nonprofit group was funded in 2005 by the us department of health and human services to develop a set of standards for electronic health records ehr and supporting networks and certify vendors who meet them in july 2006 cchit released its first list of 22 certified ambulatory ehr products in two different announcements harvard medical school added a department of biomedical informatics in 2015 the joint program allows for researchers and students to observe the impact their work has on patient care directly as discoveries are translated from bench to bedside europe further information european federation for medical informatics the european unions member states are committed to sharing their best practices and experiences to create a european ehealth area thereby improving access to and quality health care at the same time as stimulating growth in a promising new industrial sector the european ehealth action plan plays a fundamental role in the european unions strategy work on this initiative involves a collaborative approach among several parts of the commission services uk there are different models of health informatics delivery in each of the home countries england scotland northern ireland and wales but some bodies like ukchip refukchipref see below operate for those in and for all the home countries and beyond england nhs informatics in england was contracted out to several vendors for national health informatics solutions under the national programme for information technology npfit label in the early to mid2000s under the auspices of nhs connecting for health part of the health and social care information centre as of 1 april 2013 npfit originally divided the country into five regions with strategic systems integration contracts awarded to one of several local service providers lsp the various specific technical solutions were required to connect securely with the nhs spine a system designed to broker data between different systems and care settings npfit fell significantly behind schedule and its scope and design were being revised in real time exacerbated by media and political lambasting of the programmes spend past and projected against the proposed budget in 2010 a consultation was launched as part of the new conservativeliberal democrat coalition governments white paper liberating the nhs this initiative provided little in the way of innovative thinking primarily restating existing strategies within the proposed new context of the coalitions vision for the nhs the degree of computerization in nhs secondary care was quite high before npfit and the programme stagnated further development of the install base the original npfit regional approach provided neither a single nationwide solution nor local health community agility or autonomy to purchase systems but instead tried to deal with a hinterland in the middle almost all general practices in england and wales are computerized under the gp systems of choice gpsoc programme and patients have relatively extensive computerized primary care clinical records system choice is the responsibility of individual general practices and while there is no single standardized gp system gpsoc sets relatively rigid minimum standards of performance and functionality for vendors to adhere to interoperation between primary and secondary care systems is rather primitive it is hoped that a focus on interworking for interfacing and integration standards will stimulate synergy between primary and secondary care in sharing necessary information to support the care of individuals notable successes to date are in the electronic requesting and viewing of test results and in some areas gps have access to digital xray images from secondary care systems scotland scotland has an approach to the central connection underway which is more advanced than the english one in some ways scotland has the gpass system whose source code is owned by the state and controlled and developed by nhs scotland gpass was accepted in 1984 it has been provided free to all gps in scotland but has developed poorly discussion of open sourcing it as a remedy is occurring wales wales has a dedicated health informatics function that supports nhs wales in leading

asia and oceania in asia and australianew zealand the regional group called the asia pacific association for medical informatics apami was established in 1994 and now consists of more than 15 member regions in the asia pacific region australia the australasian college of health informatics achi is the professional association for health informatics in the asiapacific region it represents the interests of a broad range of clinical and nonclinical professionals working within the health informatics sphere through a commitment to quality standards and ethical practice achi is a sponsor of the ejournal for health informatics although there are a number of health informatics organizations in australia the health informatics society of australia hisa is regarded as the major umbrella group and is a member of the international medical informatics association imia nursing informaticians were the driving force behind the formation of hisa which is now a company limited by guarantee of the members the membership comes from across the informatics spectrum that is from students to corporate affiliates hisa has a number of branches queensland new south wales victoria and western australia as well as special interest groups such as nursing nia pathology aged and community care industry and medical imaging conrick 2006 china after 20 years china performed a successful transition from its planned economy to a socialist market economy along this change chinas healthcare system also experienced a significant reform to follow and adapt to this historical revolution in 2003 the data released from ministry of health of the peoples republic of china moh indicated that the national healthcareinvolved expenditure was up to rmb 66233 billion totally which accounted for about 556 of nationwide gross domestic products before the 1980s the entire healthcare costs were covered in central government annual budget since that the construct of healthcareexpended supporters started to change gradually most of the expenditure was contributed by health insurance schemes and private spending which corresponded to 40 and 45 of total expenditure respectively meanwhile the financially governmental contribution was decreased to 10 only on the other hand by 2004 up to 296492 healthcare facilities were recorded in statistic summary of moh and an average of 24 clinical beds per 1000 people were mentioned as well in china proportion of nationwide hospitals with his in china by 2004 along with the development of information technology since the 1990s healthcare providers realized that the information could generate significant benefits to improve their services by computerized cases and data for instance of gaining the information for directing patient care and assessing the best patient care for specific clinical conditions therefore substantial resources were collected to build chinas own health informatics system most of these resources were arranged to construct hospital information system his which was aimed to minimize unnecessary waste and repetition subsequently to promote the efficiency and qualitycontrol of healthcare china has four tiers in its healthcare system the first tier is street health and workplace clinics and these are cheaper than hospitals in terms of medical billing and act as prevention centers the second tier is district and enterprise hospitals along with specialist clinics and these provide the second level of care the third tier is provisional and municipal general hospitals and teaching hospitals which provided the third level of care in a tier of its own is the national hospitals which are governed by the ministry of health china has been greatly improving its health informatics since it finally opened its doors to the outside world and joined the world trade organization wto in 2001 it was reported that china had 324380 medical institutions and the majority of those were clinics the reason for that is that clinics are prevention centers and chinese people like using traditional chinese medicine as opposed to western medicine and it usually works for the minor cases china has also been improving its higher education in regards to health informatics at the end of 2002 there were 77 medical universities and medical colleges there were 48 university medical colleges which offered bachelor master and doctorate degrees in medicine there were 21 higher medical specialty institutions that offered diploma degrees so in total there were 147 higher medical and educational institutions since joining the wto china has been working hard to improve its education system and bring it up to international standards sars played a large role in china quickly improving its healthcare system back in 2003 there was an outbreak of sars and that made china hurry to spread his or hospital information system and more than 80 of hospitals had his china had been comparing itself to koreas healthcare system and figuring out how it can better its own system there was a study done that surveyed six hospitals in china that had his the results were that doctors didnt use computers as much so it was concluded that it wasnt used as much for clinical practice than it was for administrative purposes the survey asked if the hospitals created any websites and it was concluded that only four of them had created websites and that three had a thirdparty company create it for them and one was created by the hospital staff in conclusion all of them agreed or strongly agreed that providing health information on the internet should be utilized standards in china collected information at different times by different participants or systems could frequently lead to issues of misunderstanding discomparing or disexchanging to design an issuesminor system healthcare providers realized that certain standards were the basis for sharing information and interoperability however a system lacking standards would be a large impediment to interfere the improvement of corresponding information systems given that the standardization for health informatics depends on the authorities standardization events must be involved with government and the subsequently relevant funding and supports were critical in 2003 the ministry of health released the development layout of national health informatics 20032010 indicating the identification of standardization for health informatics which is combining adoption of international standards and development of national standards in china the establishment of standardization was initially facilitated with the development of vocabulary classification and coding which is conducive to reserve and transmit information for premium management at national level by 2006 55 international domestic standards of vocabulary classification and coding have served in hospital information system in 2003 the 10th revision of the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems icd10 and the icd10 clinical modification icd10cm were adopted as standards for diagnostic classification and acute care procedure classification simultaneously the international classification of primary care icpc were translated and tested in china s local applied environment another coding standard named logical observation identifiers names and codes loinc was applied to serve as general identifiers for clinical observation in hospitals personal identifier codes were widely employed in different information systems involving name sex nationality family relationship educational level and job occupation however these codes within different systems are inconsistent when sharing between different regions considering this large quantity of vocabulary classification and coding standards between different jurisdictions the healthcare provider realized that using multiple systems could generate issues of resource wasting and a nonconflicting national level standard was beneficial and necessary therefore in late 2003 the health informatics group in ministry of health released three projects to deal with issues of lacking national health information standards which were the chinese national health information framework and standardization the basic data set standards of hospital information system and the basic data set standards of public health information system objectives of chinese national health information framework and standardisation 1 establish national health information framework and identify in what areas standards and guidelines are required 2 identify the classes relationships and attributes of national health information framework produce a conceptual health data model to cover the scope of the health information framework 3 create logical data model for specific domains depicting the logical data entities the data attributes and the relationships between the entities according to the conceptual health data model 4 establish uniform represent standard for data elements according to the data entities and their attributes in conceptual data model and logical data model 5 circulate the completed health information framework and health data model to the partnership members for review and acceptance 6 develop a process to maintain and refine the china model and to align with and influence international health data models comparison between chinas ehr standard and segments of the astm e 1384 standard recently researchers from local universities evaluated the performance of

which indicates certain domains of improvement for future revisions of ehr standard in china meticulously these deficiencies are listed in the following the lack of supporting on privacy and security the isots 18308 specifies the ehr must support the ethical and legal use of personal information in accordance with established privacy principles and frameworks which may be culturally or jurisdictionally specific iso 18308 health informaticsrequirements for an electronic health record architecture 2004 however this chinas ehr standard did not achieve any of the fifteen requirements in the subclass of privacy and security the shortage of supporting on different types of data and reference considering only icd9 is referenced as chinas external international coding systems other similar systems such as snomed ct in clinical terminology presentation cannot be considered as familiar for chinese specialists which could lead to internationally informationsharing deficiency the

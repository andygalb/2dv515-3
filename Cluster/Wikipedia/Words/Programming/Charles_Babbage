charles babbage babbage redirects here for other uses see babbage disambiguation charles babbage kh frs bbd 26 december 1791 18 october 1871 was an english polymath considered by some to be a father of the computer parts of babbages incomplete mechanisms are on display in the science museum in london in 1991 a functioning difference engine was constructed from babbages original plans built to tolerances achievable in the 19th century the success of the finished engine indicated that babbages machine would have worked early life engraving of charles babbage dated 1833 babbages birthplace is disputed but according to the oxford dictionary of national biography he was most likely born at 44 crosby row walworth road london england his date of birth was given in his obituary in the times as 26 december 1792 but then a nephew wrote to say that babbage was born one year earlier in 1791 the parish register of st marys newington london shows that babbage was baptised on 6 january 1792 supporting a birth year of 1791 babbage c 1850 babbage was one of four children of benjamin babbage and betsy plumleigh teape his father was a banking partner of william praed in founding praeds co of fleet street london in 1801 babbage then joined the 30student holmwood academy in baker street enfield middlesex under the reverend stephen freeman the academy had a library that prompted babbages love of mathematics he studied with two more private tutors after leaving the academy the first was a clergyman near cambridge through him babbage encountered charles simeon and his evangelical followers but the tuition was not what he needed the second was an oxford tutor under whom babbage reached a level in classics sufficient to be accepted by cambridge at the university of cambridge babbage arrived at trinity college cambridge in october 1810 babbage john herschel george peacock and several other friends formed the analytical society in 1812 they were also close to edward ryan in 1812 babbage transferred to peterhouse cambridge after cambridge considering his reputation babbage quickly made progress he lectured to the royal institution on astronomy in 1815 and was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1816 with herschel babbage worked on the electrodynamics of aragos rotations publishing in 1825 their explanations were only transitional being picked up and broadened by michael faraday the phenomena are now part of the theory of eddy currents and babbage and herschel missed some of the clues to unification of electromagnetic theory staying close to ampres force law babbage purchased the actuarial tables of george barrett who died in 1821 leaving unpublished work and surveyed the field in 1826 in comparative view of the various institutions for the assurance of lives during this whole period babbage depended awkwardly on his fathers support given his fathers attitude to his early marriage of 1814 he and edward ryan wedded the whitmore sisters he made a home in marylebone in london and founded a large family royal astronomical society babbage was instrumental in founding the royal astronomical society in 1820 initially known as the astronomical society of london these directions were closely connected with babbages ideas on computation and in 1824 he won its gold medal cited for his invention of an engine for calculating mathematical and astronomical tables babbages motivation to overcome errors in tables by mechanisation has been a commonplace since dionysius lardner wrote about it in 1834 in the edinburgh review under babbages guidance a portion of the difference engine babbage studied the requirements to establish a modern postal system with his friend thomas frederick colby concluding there should be a uniform rate that was put into effect with the introduction of the uniform fourpenny post supplanted by the uniform penny post british lagrangian school the analytical society had initially been no more than an undergraduate provocation during this period it had some more substantial achievements in 1816 babbage herschel and peacock published a translation from french of the lectures of sylvestre lacroix which was then the stateoftheart calculus textbook reference to lagrange in calculus terms marks out the application of what are now called formal power series british mathematicians had used them from about 1730 to 1760 as reintroduced they were not simply applied as notations in differential calculus they opened up the fields of functional equations including the difference equations fundamental to the difference engine and operator dmodule methods for differential equations the analogy of difference and differential equations was notationally changing to d as a finite difference becomes infinitesimal these symbolic directions became popular as operational calculus and pushed to the point of diminishing returns the cauchy concept of limit was kept at bay in this context function composition is complicated to express because the chain rule is not simply applied to second and higher derivatives this matter was known to woodhouse by 1803 who took from louis franois antoine arbogast what is now called fa di brunos formula in essence it was known to abraham de moivre 1697 herschel found the method impressive babbage knew of it and it was later noted by ada lovelace as compatible with the analytical engine academic from 1828 to 1839 babbage was lucasian professor of mathematics at cambridge not a conventional resident don and inattentive to teaching he wrote three topical books during this period of his life he was elected a foreign honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1832 it was during this period that babbage tried to enter politics simon schaffer writes that his views of the 1830s included disestablishment of the church of england a broader political franchise and inclusion of manufacturers as stakeholders declinarians learned societies and the baas letter to sir humphry davy 1822 babbage now emerged as a polemicist one of his biographers notes that all his books contain a campaigning element his reflections on the decline of science and some of its causes 1830 stands out however for its sharp attacks it aimed to improve british science and more particularly to oust davies gilbert as president of the royal society which babbage wished to reform the mechanics magazine in 1831 identified as declinarians the followers of babbage in an unsympathetic tone it pointed out david brewster writing in the quarterly review as another leader with the barb that both babbage and brewster had received public money in the debate of the period on statistics qua data collection and what is now statistical inference the baas in its statistical section which owed something also to whewell opted for data collection this section was the sixth established in 1833 with babbage as chairman and john elliot drinkwater as secretary the foundation of the statistical society followed on the economy of machinery and manufactures on the economy of machinery and manufactures 1835 babbages notation for machine parts explanation from on a method of expressing by signs the action of machinery 1827 of his mechanical notation invented for his own use in understanding the work on the difference engine and an influence on the conception of the analytical engine babbage published on the economy of machinery and manufactures 1832 on the organisation of industrial production it was an influential early work of operational research the book sold well and quickly went to a fourth edition 1836 babbage principle in economy of machinery was described what is now called the babbage principle it pointed out commercial advantages available with more careful division of labour as babbage himself noted it had already appeared in the work of melchiorre gioia in 1815 what babbage remarked is that skilled workers typically spend parts of their time performing tasks that are below their skill level if the labour process can be divided among several workers labour costs may be cut by assigning only highskill tasks to highcost workers restricting other tasks to lowerpaid workers publishing another aspect of the work was its detailed breakdown of the cost structure of book publishing babbage took the unpopular line from the publishers perspective of exposing the trades profitability influence it has been written that what arthur young was to agriculture charles babbage was to the factory visit and machinery john ruskin went further to oppose completely what manufacturing in babbages sense stood for works by babbage and ure were published in french translation in 1830 mary boole the wife of babbages collaborator george boole claimed that there was profound influence via her uncle george everest of indian thought in general and indian logic in particular on him and on george boole as well as on augustus de morgan think what must have been the effect of the intense hinduizing of three such men as babbage de morgan and george boole on the mathematical atmosphere of 183065 what share had it in generating the vector analysis and the mathematics by which investigations in physical science are now conducted natural theology in 1837 responding to the series of eight bridgewater treatises babbage published his ninth bridgewater treatise under the title on the power wisdom and goodness of god as manifested in the creation in this work babbage weighed in on the side of uniformitarianism in a current debate the book is a work of natural theology and incorporates extracts from related correspondence of herschel with charles lyell the ninth bridgewater treatise was quoted extensively in vestiges of the natural history of creation plate from the ninth bridgewater treatise showing a parametric family of algebraic curves acquiring isolated real points jonar ganeri author of indian logic believes babbage may have been influenced by indian thought one possible route would be through henry thomas colebrooke mary everest boole argues that babbage was introduced to indian thought in the 1820s by her uncle george everest some time about 1825 religious views babbage was raised in the protestant form of the christian faith his family having inculcated in him an orthodox form of worship

taught me the usual forms of my daily and nightly prayer and neither in my father nor my mother was there any mixture of bigotry and intolerance on the one hand nor on the other of that unbecoming and familiar mode of addressing the almighty which afterwards so much disgusted me in my youthful yearsbabbage 1864 rejecting the athanasian creed as a direct contradiction in terms in his youth he looked to samuel clarkes works on religion of which being and attributes of god 1704 exerted a particularly strong influence on him later in life babbage concluded that the true value of the christian religion rested not on speculative in his autobiography passages from the life of a philosopher 1864 babbage wrote a whole chapter on the topic of religion where he identified three sources of divine knowledge a priori or mystical experience from revelation from the examination of the works of the creator he stated on the basis of the design argument that studying the works of nature had been the more appealing evidence and the one which led him to actively profess the existence of god advocating for natural theology he wrote in the works of the creator ever open to our examination we possess a firm basis on which to raise the superstructure of an enlightened creed the more man inquires into the laws which regulate the material universe the more he is convinced that all its varied forms arise from the action of a few simple principles the works of the creator ever present to our senses give a living and perpetual testimony of his power and goodness far surpassing any evidence transmitted through human testimony the testimony of man becomes fainter at every stage of transmission whilst each new inquiry into the works of the almighty gives to us more exalted views of his wisdom his goodness and his powerbabbage 1864 like samuel vince babbage also wrote a defence of the belief in divine miracles he alluded to the limits of human experience expressing all that we see in a miracle is an effect which is new to our observation and whose cause is concealed the cause may be beyond the sphere of our observation and would be thus beyond the familiar sphere of nature but this does not make the event a violation of any law of nature the limits of mans observation lie within very narrow boundaries and it would be arrogance to suppose that the reach of mans power is to form the limits of the natural world later life the illustrated london news 4 november 1871 the british association was consciously modelled on the deutsche naturforscherversammlung founded in 1822 metrology programme a project announced by babbage was to tabulate all physical constants referred to as constants of nature a phrase in itself a neologism and then to compile an encyclopaedic work of numerical information he was a pioneer in the field of absolute measurement exact measurement was also key to the development of machine tools here again babbage is considered a pioneer with henry maudslay william sellers and joseph whitworth engineer and inventor through the royal society babbage acquired the friendship of the engineer marc brunel it was through brunel that babbage knew of joseph clement and so came to encounter the artisans whom he observed in his work on manufactures in 1838 babbage invented the pilot also called a cowcatcher the metal frame attached to the front of locomotives that clears the tracks of obstacles babbage also invented an ophthalmoscope which he gave to thomas wharton jones for testing jones however ignored it the device only came into use after being independently invented by hermann von helmholtz cryptography babbage achieved notable results in cryptography though this was still not known a century after his death letter frequency was category 18 of babbages tabulation project joseph henry later defended interest in it in the absence of the facts as relevant to the management of movable type as early as 1845 babbage had solved a cipher that had been posed as a challenge by his nephew henry hollier and in the process he made a discovery about ciphers that were based on vigenre tables specifically he realized that enciphering plain text with a keyword rendered the cipher text subject to modular arithmetic public nuisances babbage involved himself in wellpublicised but unpopular campaigns against public nuisances he once counted all the broken panes of glass of a factory publishing in 1857 a table of the relative frequency of the causes of breakage of plate glass windows of 464 broken panes 14 were caused by drunken men women or boys babbages distaste for commoners the mob included writing observations of street nuisances in 1864 as well as tallying up 165 nuisances over a period of 80 days he especially hated street music and in particular the music of organ grinders against whom he railed in various venues the following quotation is typical it is difficult to estimate the misery inflicted upon thousands of persons and the absolute pecuniary penalty imposed upon multitudes of intellectual workers by the loss of their time destroyed by organgrinders and other similar nuisances babbage was not alone in his campaign a convert to the cause was the mp michael thomas bass in the 1860s babbage also took up the antihooprolling campaign he blamed hooprolling boys for driving their iron hoops under horses legs with the result that the rider is thrown and very often the horse breaks a leg computing pioneer part of charles babbages difference engine 1 assembled after his death by his son henry prevost babbage 18241918 using parts found in charles laboratory babbages machines were among the first mechanical computers that they were not actually completed was largely because of funding problems and clashes of personality most notably with airy the astronomer royal babbage directed the building of some steampowered machines that achieved some modest success suggesting that calculations could be mechanised for more than ten years he received government funding for his project which amounted to 17000 but eventually the treasury lost confidence in him while babbages machines were mechanical and unwieldy their basic architecture was similar to a modern computer the data and program memory were separated operation was instructionbased the control unit could make conditional jumps and the machine had a separate io unit background on mathematical tables in babbages time printed mathematical tables were calculated by human computers in other words by hand they were central to navigation science and engineering as well as mathematics mistakes were known to occur in transcription as well as calculation at cambridge babbage saw the fallibility of this process and the opportunity of adding mechanisation into its management his own account of his path towards mechanical computation references a particular occasion in 1812 he was sitting in his rooms in the analytical society looking at a table of logarithms which he knew to be full of mistakes when the idea occurred to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery the french government had produced several tables by a new method three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages and the work itself which was restricted to addition and subtraction was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes here for the first time mass production was applied to arithmetic and babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers there was another period seven years later when his interest was aroused by the issues around computation of mathematical tables the french official initiative by gaspard de prony and its problems of implementation were familiar to him after the napoleonic wars came to a close scientific contacts were renewed on the level of personal contact in 1819 charles blagden was in paris looking into the printing of the stalled de prony project and lobbying for the support of the royal society in works of the 1820s and 1830s babbage referred in detail to de pronys project difference engine the science museums difference engine no 2 built from babbages design difference engine babbage began in 1822 with what he called the difference engine made to compute values of polynomial functions it was created to calculate a series of values automatically by using the method of finite differences it was possible to avoid the need for multiplication and division for a prototype difference engine babbage brought in joseph clement to implement the design in 1823 clement worked to high standards but his machine tools were particularly elaborate under the standard terms of business of the time he could charge for their construction and would also own them he and babbage fell out over costs around 1831 some parts of the prototype survive in the museum of the history of science oxford this prototype evolved into the first difference engine it remained unfinished and the finished portion is located at the science museum in london this first difference engine would have been composed of around 25000 parts weighed fifteen tons 13600kg and would have been 8ft 24m tall although babbage received ample funding for the project it was never completed he later 18471849 produced detailed drawings for an improved versiondifference engine no 2 but did not receive funding from the british government his design was finally constructed in 19891991 using his plans and 19thcentury manufacturing tolerances it performed its first calculation at the science museum london returning results to 31 digits nine years later in 2000 the science museum completed the printer babbage had designed for the difference engine completed models the science museum has constructed two difference engines according to babbages plans for the difference engine no 2 one is owned by the museum the other owned by the technology multimillionaire nathan myhrvold went on exhibition at the computer history museum analytical engine analytical engine after the attempt at making the first difference engine fell through babbage worked to design a more complex machine called the analytical engine he hired c g jarvis who had previously worked for clement as a draughtsman the major innovation was that the analytical engine was to be programmed using punched cards the engine was intended to use loops of jacquards punched cards to control a mechanical calculator which could use as input the results of preceding computations part of the analytical engine on display in 1843 left of centre in this engraving of the king george iii museum in kings college london ada lovelace and italian followers ada lovelace who corresponded with babbage during his development of the analytical engine is credited with developing an algorithm that would enable the engine to calculate a sequence of bernoulli numbers lovelace also translated and wrote literature supporting the project describing the engines programming by punch cards she wrote we may say most aptly that the analytical engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves babbage visited turin in 1840 at the invitation of giovanni plana in 1842 charles wheatstone approached lovelace to translate a paper of luigi menabrea who had taken notes of babbages turin talks and babbage asked her to add something of her own fortunato prandi who acted as interpreter in turin was an italian exile and follower of giuseppe mazzini swedish followers per georg scheutz wrote about the difference engine in 1830 and experimented in automated computation after 1834 and lardners edinburgh review article he set up a project of his own doubting whether babbages initial plan could be carried out this he pushed through with his son edvard scheutz legacy in 2011 researchers in britain proposed a multimillionpound project plan 28 to construct babbages analytical engine since babbages plans were continually being refined and were never completed they intended to engage the public in the project and crowdsource the analysis of what should be built advances in mems and nanotechnology have led to recent hightech experiments in mechanical computation the benefits suggested include operation in high radiation or high temperature environments due to his association with the town babbage was chosen in 2007 to appear on the 5 totnes pound note family babbages grave at kensal green cemetery

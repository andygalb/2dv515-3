netbeans netbeans is an integrated development environment ide for java netbeans allows applications to be developed from a set of modular software components called modules netbeans runs on microsoft windows macos linux and solaris in addition to java development it has extensions for other languages like php c c html5 history netbeans began in 1996 as xelfi word play on delphi netbeans ide

support for developing ide modules and rich client applications based on the netbeans platform a java swing gui builder formerly known as project matisse improved cvs support weblogic 9 and jboss 4 support and many editor enhancements netbeans 6 is available in official repositories of major linux distributions netbeans ide 65 released in november 2008 extended the existing java ee features including java persistence support ejb 3 and jaxws additionally the netbeans enterprise pack supports the development of java ee 5 enterprise applications including soa visual design tools xml schema tools web services orchestration for bpel and uml modeling the netbeans ide bundle for cc supports cc and fortran development netbeans ide 68 is the first ide to provide complete support of java ee 6 and the glassfish enterprise server v3 developers hosting their opensource projects on kenaicom additionally benefit from instant messaging and issue tracking integration and navigation right in the ide support for web application development with php 53 and the symfony framework and improved code completion layouts hints and navigation in javafx projects netbeans ide 69 released in june 2010 added support for osgi spring framework 30 java ee dependency injection jsr299 zend framework for php and easier code navigation such as is overriddenimplemented annotations formatting hints and refactoring across several languages netbeans ide 70 was released in april 2011 on august 1 2011 the netbeans team released netbeans ide 701 which has full support for the official release of the java

incubator project netbeans platform netbeans screenshot the netbeans platform is a framework for simplifying the development of java swing desktop applications the netbeans ide bundle for java se contains what is needed to start developing netbeans plugins and netbeans platform based applications no additional sdk is required applications can install modules dynamically any application can include the update center module to allow users of the application to download digitally signed upgrades and new features directly into the running application reinstalling an upgrade or a new release does not force users to download the entire application again the platform offers reusable services common to desktop applications allowing developers to focus on the logic specific to their application among the features of the platform are user interface management eg menus and toolbars user settings management storage management saving and loading any kind of data window management wizard framework supports stepbystep dialogs netbeans visual library integrated development tools a showcase of applications developed on top of netbeans platform is available at httpsnetbeansorgfeaturesplatformshowcasehtml netbeans ide netbeans ide is an opensource integrated development environment netbeans ide supports development of all java application types java se including javafx java me web ejb and mobile applications out of the box among other features are an antbased project system maven support refactorings version control supporting cvs subversion git mercurial and clearcase modularity all the functions of the ide are provided by modules each module provides a welldefined function such as support for the java language editing or support for the cvs versioning system and svn netbeans contains all the modules needed for java development in a single download allowing the user to start working immediately modules also allow netbeans to be extended new features such as support for other programming languages can be added by installing additional modules for instance sun studio sun java studio enterprise and sun java studio creator from sun microsystems are all based on the netbeans ide license from july 2006 through 2007 netbeans ide was licensed under suns common development and distribution license cddl a license based on the mozilla public license mpl in october 2007 sun announced that netbeans would henceforth be offered under a dual license of the cddl and the gpl version 2 licenses with the gpl linking exception for gnu classpath the netbeans community blog has announced that oracle is proposing to entrust the development of the netbeans platform and ide to the apache foundation to open up the government model reaffirming its commitment to the project netbeans is currently submitted as a proposal to apache and it will enter incubation if accepted other products in an october 2016 interview with gabriela motroc oracle vice president bill pataky stated that oracle has a number of products that depend on netbeans oracle developer studio a commercial c c fortran and java development environment is 100 based on netbeans oracle jdeveloper an endtoend development for oracles technology stack takes major subsystems from netbeans oracle javascript extension toolkit a modular open source toolkit based on modern javascript css3 and html5 design and development principles uses netbeans as its preferred ide integrated modules these modules are part of the netbeans ide netbeans profiler the netbeans profiler is a tool for the monitoring of java applications it helps developers find memory leaks and optimize speed formerly downloaded separately it is integrated into the core ide since version 60 the profiler is based on a sun laboratories research project that was named jfluid that research uncovered specific techniques that can be used to lower the overhead of profiling a java application one of those techniques is dynamic bytecode instrumentation which is particularly useful for profiling large java applications using dynamic bytecode instrumentation and additional algorithms the netbeans profiler is able to obtain runtime information on applications that are too large or complex for other profilers netbeans also support profiling points that let you profile precise points of execution and measure execution time netbeans gui builder gui design tool formerly known as project matisse the gui designtool enables developers to prototype and design swing guis by dragging and positioning gui components the gui builder has builtin support for jsr 295 beans binding technology but the support for jsr 296 swing application framework was removed in 71 netbeans javascript editor the netbeans javascript editor provides extended support for javascript ajax and css javascript editor features comprise syntax highlighting refactoring code completion for native objects and functions generation of javascript class skeletons generation of ajax callbacks from a template and automatic browser compatibility checks css editor features comprise code completion for styles names quick navigation through the navigator panel displaying the css rule declaration in a list view and file structure in a tree view sorting the outline view by name type or declaration order list tree creating rule declarations tree only refactoring a part of a rule name tree only the netbeans 74 and later uses the new javascript engine developed by oracle netbeans ide download bundles users can choose to download netbeans ide bundles tailored to specific development needs users can also download and install all other features at a later date directly through the netbeans ide netbeans ide bundle for web and java ee the netbeans ide bundle for web java ee provides complete tools for all the latest java ee 6 standards including the new java ee 6 web profile enterprise java beans ejbs servlets java persistence api web services and annotations netbeans also supports the jsf 20 facelets javaserver pages jsp hibernate spring and struts frameworks and the java ee 5 and j2ee 14 platforms it includes glassfish and apache tomcat some of its features with javaee includes improved support for cdi rest services and java persistence new support for bean validation support for jsf component libraries including bundled primefaces library improved editing for expression language in jsf including code completion refactoring and hints netbeans ide bundle for php netbeans supports php since version 65 the bundle for php includes syntax highlighting code completion occurrence highlighting error highlighting cvs version control semantic analysis with highlighting of parameters and unused local variables php code debugging with xdebug php unit testing with phpunit and selenium code coverage symfony framework support since version 68 zend framework support since version 69

adele goldstine adele goldstine ne katz december 21 1920 november 1964 was an american mathematician and computer programmer she wrote the manual for the first electronic digital computer eniac through her work programming the computer she was also an instrumental player in converting the eniac from a computer that needed to be reprogrammed each time it was used to one that was able to perform a set of fifty stored instructions early life and education goldstine was born in new york city on december 21 1920 to jewish parents work on eniac as an instructor of mathematics for the women computers at the moore school of electrical engineering goldstine also trained some of the six women who were the original programmers of eniac to manually calculate ballistic trajectories complex differential calculations by 1943 and for the balance of world war ii essentially all computers were women as were their direct supervisors she wrote the operators manual for the eniac after the six women kay mcnulty betty jean jennings betty snyder marlyn wescoff fran bilas and ruth lichterman trained themselves to program the eniac using its logical and electrical block diagram during this time programming the machine meant moving dials and cables manually in 1946 goldstine sat in on programming sessions with bartik and dick clippinger and was hired to help implement clippingers stored program modification to the eniac john von neumann was a consultant on the selection of the instruction set implemented this solved the problem of the programmers having to unplug and replug patch cables for every program the machine was to run instead the program was entered on the three function tables which had previously been used only for storage of a trajectorys drag function eniac programmer jean bartik called goldstine one of her three great programming partners along with betty holberton and art gehring postwar years after the war goldstine continued her programming work with von neumann at los alamos national laboratory where she devised problems for eniac to process kathleen antonelli jean bartik betty holberton marlyn meltzer frances spence ruth teitelbaum footnotes

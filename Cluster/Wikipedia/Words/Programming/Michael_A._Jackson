programs for ibm and honeywell machines working in assembler there jackson found his calling as he recollected in 2000 although i was a careful designer drawing meticulous flowcharts before coding and a conscientious tester i realised that program design was hard and the results likely to be erroneous information system design was in need of a structured approach in 1964 jackson joined the new consultancy firm john hoskyns and company in london before founding his own company michael jackson systems limited in 1971 in the 1960s he had started his search for more reliable and systematic way of programming a virtual architecture for specification and implementation of telecommunication services jackson received the stevens award for software development methods in 1997 in 1961 jackson married judith wendy blackburn work jackson has developed a series of methods each of these methods covers a wider scope than the previous one and builds on ideas that appeared but were not fully developed in the previous one reading his books in sequence allows you to follow the evolution of his thinking jackson structured programming jackson structured programming jsp was the first software development method that jackson developed it is a program design method and was described in his book principles of program design jsp covers the design of individual programs but not systems jackson system development the jackson system development jsd was the second software development method that jackson developed jsd is a system development method not just for individual programs but for entire systems jsd is most readily applicable to information systems but it can easily be extended to the development of realtime embedded systems jsd was described in his book system development problem frames approach problem analysis or the problem frames approach was the third software development method that jackson developed it concerns itself with aspects of developing all kinds of software not just information systems it was first sketched in his book software requirements and specifications and described much more fully in his book problem frames the first international workshop on applications and advances in problem frames was held as part of icse04 held in edinburgh scotland publications his books include 1975 principles of program design mwparseroutput

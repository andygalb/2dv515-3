capability maturity model integration cmmi is a process level improvement training and appraisal program administered by the cmmi institute a subsidiary of isaca it was developed at carnegie mellon university cmu it is required by many united states department of defense dod and us government contracts especially in software development cmu claims cmmi can be used to guide process improvement across a project division or an entire organization cmmi defines the following maturity levels for processes initial managed defined quantitatively managed and optimizing version 20 was published in 2018 version 13 was published in 2010 and is the reference model for the remaining information in this wiki article cmmi is registered in the us patent and trademark office by cmu overview characteristics of the maturity levels originally cmmi addresses three areas of interest product and service development cmmi for development cmmidev service establishment management cmmi for services cmmisvc and product and service acquisition cmmi for acquisition cmmiacq in version 20 these three areas that previously had a separate model each were merged into a single model see below for details cmmi was developed by a group from industry government and the software engineering institute sei at cmu cmmi models provide guidance for developing or improving processes that meet the business goals of an organization a cmmi model may also be used as a framework for appraising the process maturity of the organization cmmi originated in software engineering but has been highly generalized over the years to embrace other areas of interest such as the development of hardware products the delivery of all kinds of services and the acquisition of products and services the word software does not appear in definitions of cmmi this generalization of improvement concepts makes cmmi extremely abstract it is not as specific to software engineering as its predecessor the software cmm cmm see below it is important to realize that cmmi is a model and not a standard in other words for each area of practice it specifies a general intent and different levels of maturity in abstract terms it does not provide a prescription how to achieve those levels it does provide detailed abstract information and examples which serve as guidelines to understanding and implementations but the particular way of implementing is up to the organization history cmmi was developed by the cmmi project which aimed to improve the usability of maturity models by integrating many different models into one framework the project consisted of members of industry government and the carnegie mellon software engineering institute sei the main sponsors included the office of the secretary of defense osd and the national defense industrial association cmmi is the successor of the capability maturity model cmm or software cmm the cmm was developed from 1987 until 1997 in 2002 version 11 was released version 12 followed in august 2006 and version 13 in november 2010 some major changes in cmmi v13 according to the software engineering institute sei 2008 cmmi helps integrate traditionally separate organizational functions set process improvement goals and priorities provide guidance for quality processes and provide a point of reference for appraising current processes in march 2016 the cmmi institute was acquired by isaca in march 2018 cmmi 20 was introduced not free for the first time in cmmi history the cheapest option was 1week access to the online version at us15000 cmmi topics representation in version 13 cmmi existed in two representations continuous and staged in version 20 the above representation separation was cancelled and there is now only one cohesive model model framework v20 the model is divided into 4 categories 9 capabilities and 20 process areas with initialisms in parenthesis and highest maturity levels attainable in square brackets doing ensuring

best practices are published in documents called models each of which addresses a different area of interest version 13 provides models for three areas of interest development acquisition and services cmmi for development cmmidev v13 was released in november 2010 it addresses product and service development processes cmmi for acquisition cmmiacq v13 was released in november 2010 it addresses supply chain management acquisition and outsourcing processes in government and industry cmmi for services cmmisvc v13 was released in november 2010 it addresses guidance for delivering services within an organization and to external customers model v20 in version 20 dev acq and svc were merged into a single model where each process area potentially has a specific reference to one or more of these three aspects trying to keep up with the industry the model also has explicit reference to agile aspects in some process areas appraisal an organization cannot be certified in cmmi instead an organization is appraised depending on the type of appraisal the organization can be awarded a maturity level rating 15 or a capability level achievement profile many organizations find value in measuring their progress by conducting an appraisal appraisals are typically conducted for one or more of the following reasons to determine how well the organizations processes compare to cmmi best practices and to identify areas where improvement can be made to inform external customers and suppliers of how well the organizations processes compare to cmmi best practices to meet the contractual requirements of one or more customers appraisals of organizations using a cmmi model must conform to the requirements defined in the appraisal requirements for cmmi arc document there are three classes of appraisals a b and c which focus on identifying improvement opportunities and comparing the organizations processes to cmmi best practices of these class a appraisal is the most formal and is the only one that can result in a level rating appraisal teams use a cmmi model and arcconformant appraisal method to guide their evaluation of the organization and their reporting of conclusions the appraisal results can then be used eg by a process group to plan improvements for the organization the standard cmmi appraisal method for process improvement scampi is an appraisal method that meets all of the arc requirements results of a scampi appraisal may be published if the appraised organization approves on the cmmi web site of the sei published scampi appraisal results scampi also supports the conduct of isoiec 15504 also known as spice software process improvement and capability determination assessments etc this approach promotes that members of the epg and pats be trained in the cmmi that an informal scampi c appraisal be performed and that process areas be prioritized for improvement more modern approaches that involve the deployment of commercially available cmmicompliant processes can significantly reduce the time to achieve compliance sei has maintained statistics on the time to move up for organizations adopting the earlier software cmm as well as cmmi the software engineering institutes sei team software process methodology and the use of cmmi models can be used to raise the maturity level a new product called accelerated improvement method security to address user security concerns two unofficial security guides are available considering the case for security content in cmmi for services has one process area security management security by design with cmmi for development version 13 has the following process areas opsd organizational preparedness for secure development smp secure management in projects srts security requirements and technical solution svv security verification and validation while they do not affect maturity or capability levels these process areas can be reported in appraisal results applications the sei published that 60 organizations measured increases of performance in the categories of cost schedule productivity quality and customer satisfaction the median increase in performance varied between 14 customer satisfaction and 62 productivity however the cmmi model mostly deals with what processes should be implemented and not so much with how they can be implemented these results do not guarantee that applying cmmi will increase performance in every organization a small company with few resources may be less likely to benefit from cmmi this view is supported by the process maturity profile page 10 of the small organizations 25 employees 705 are assessed at level 2 managed while 528 of the organizations with 10012000 employees are rated at the highest level 5 optimizing turner jain 2002 argue that although it is obvious there are large differences between cmmi and agile software development both approaches have much in common they believe neither way is the right way to develop software but that there are phases in a project where one of the two is better suited they suggest one should combine the different fragments of the methods into a new hybrid method sutherland et al 2007 assert that a combination of scrum and cmmi brings more adaptability and predictability than either one alone david j anderson 2005 gives hints on how to interpret cmmi in an agile manner cmmi roadmaps these roadmaps combine the strengths of both the staged and the continuous representations the combination of the project management technique earned value management evm with cmmi has been described solomon 2002 to conclude with a similar use of cmmi extreme programming xp a software engineering method has been evaluated with cmmcmmi nawrocki et al 2002 for example the xp requirements management approach which relies on oral communication was evaluated as not compliant with cmmi cmmi can be appraised using two different approaches staged and continuous the staged approach yields appraisal results as one of five maturity levels the continuous approach yields one of four capability levels the differences in these approaches are felt only in the appraisal the best practices are equivalent and result in equivalent process improvement results software engineering process group capability immaturity model capability maturity model enterprise architecture assessment framework

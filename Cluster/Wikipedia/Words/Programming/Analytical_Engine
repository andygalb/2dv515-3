generalpurpose computer designed by english mathematician and computer pioneer charles babbage babbage was never able to complete construction of any of his machines due to conflicts with his chief engineer and inadequate funding design two types of punched cards used to program the machine foreground operational cards for inputting instructions background variable cards for inputting data babbages first attempt at a mechanical computing device the difference engine was a specialpurpose machine designed to tabulate logarithms and trigonometric functions by evaluating finite differences to create approximating polynomials construction of this machine was never completed babbage had conflicts with his chief engineer joseph clement and ultimately the british government withdrew its funding for the project during this project he realized that a much more general design the analytical engine was possible the input consisting of programs and data formulae and data there was to be a store that is a memory capable of holding 1000 numbers of 40 decimal digits the programming language to be employed by users was akin to modern day assembly languages loops and conditional branching were possible and so the language as conceived would have been turingcomplete as later defined by alan turing three different types of punch cards were used one for arithmetical operations one for numerical constants and one for load and store operations transferring numbers from the store to the arithmetical unit or back there were three separate readers for the three types of cards babbage developed some two dozen programs for the analytical engine between 1837 and 1840 and one program later in 1842 the italian mathematician luigi federico menabrea published a description of the engine based on a lecture by babbage in french in 1843 the description was translated into english and extensively annotated by ada lovelace who had become interested in the engine eight years earlier in recognition of her additions to menabreas paper which included a way to calculate bernoulli numbers using the machine she has been described as the first computer programmer construction henry babbages analytical engine mill built in 1910 in the science museum london late in his life babbage sought ways to build a simplified version of the machine and assembled a small part of it before his death in 1871 in 1878 a committee of the british association for the advancement of science described the analytical engine as a marvel of mechanical ingenuity but recommended against constructing it the committee acknowledged the usefulness and value of the machine but could not estimate the cost of building it and were unsure whether the machine would function correctly after being built intermittently from 1880 to 1910 in 1991 the london science museum built a complete and working specimen of babbages difference engine no 2 a design that incorporated refinements babbage discovered during the development of the analytical engine in october 2010 john grahamcumming started a plan 28 campaign to raise funds by public subscription to enable serious historical and academic study of babbages plans with a view to then build and test a fully working virtual design which will then in turn enable construction of the physical analytical engine instruction set plan diagram of the analytical engine from 1840 babbage is not known to have written down an explicit set of instructions for the engine in the manner of a modern processor manual instead he showed his programs as lists of states during their execution showing what operator was run at each step with little indication of how the control flow would be guided allan g bromley has assumed that the card deck could be read in forwards and backwards directions as a function of conditional branching after testing for conditions which would make the engine turingcomplete the cards could be ordered to move forward and reverse and hence to loop the introduction for the first time in 1845 of user operations for a variety of service functions including most importantly an effective system for user control of looping in user programs there is no indication how the direction of turning of the operation and variable cards is specified in the absence of other evidence i have had to adopt the minimal default assumption that both the operation and variable cards can only be turned backward as is necessary to implement the loops used in babbages sample programs there would be no mechanical or microprogramming difficulty in placing the direction of motion under the control of the user in their emulator of the engine fourmilab say the engines card reader is not constrained to simply process the cards in a chain one after another from start to finish it can in addition directed by the very cards it reads and advised by the whether the mills runup lever is activated either advance the card chain forward skipping the intervening cards or backward causing previouslyread cards to be processed once again this emulator does provide a written symbolic instruction set though this has been constructed by its authors rather than based on babbages original works for example a factorial program would be written as n0 6 n1 1 n2 1 l1 l0 s1 l0 l2 s0 l2 l0 cb11 where the cb is the conditional branch instruction or combination card used to make the control flow jump in this case backwards by 11 cards influence predicted influence babbage understood that the existence of an automatic computer would kindle interest in the field now known as algorithmic efficiency writing in his passages from the life of a philosopher as soon as an analytical engine exists it will necessarily guide the future course of the science whenever any result is sought by its aid the question will then ariseby what course of calculation can these results be arrived at by the machine in the shortest time computer science from 1872 henry continued diligently with his fathers work and then intermittently in retirement in 1875 percy ludgate wrote about the engine in 1914 and designed his own analytical engine it was drawn up in detail but never built about 19071909 torres y quevedo wrote about babbages engines in essays on automatics 1913 book contains design for an electromechanical machine capable of calculating completely automatically the value of a function vannevar bushs paper instrumental analysis 1936 included several references to babbages work in the same year started rapid arithmetical machine project to investigate the problems of constructing an electronic digital computer despite this groundwork babbages work fell into historical obscurity and the analytical engine was unknown to builders of electromechanical and electronic computing machines in the 1930s and 1940s when they began their work resulting in the need to reinvent many of the architectural innovations babbage had proposed howard aiken who built the quicklyobsoleted electromechanical calculator the harvard mark i between 1937 and 1945 praised babbages work likely as a way of enhancing his own stature but knew nothing of the analytical engines architecture during the construction of the mark i and considered his visit to the constructed portion of the analytical engine the greatest disappointment of my life comparison to other early computers if the analytical engine had been built it would have been digital programmable and turingcomplete it would however have been very slow luigi federico menabrea reported in sketch of the analytical engine mr babbage believes he can by his engine form the product of two numbers each containing twenty figures in three minutes by comparison the harvard mark i could perform the same task in just six seconds a modern pc can do the same thing in well under a billionth of a second further information history of computing hardware early digital computer

difference engine in which babbages difference and analytical engines became available to victorian society the novel explores the consequences and implications of the early introduction of computational technology there is also mention of the analytical engine or the clockwork ouroboros as it is also known there in the book of the war a faction paradox anthology edited by lawrence miles this machine was used to calculate a way into the eleven day empire its use resulted in the destruction of the original houses of parliament in the novel perdido street station by british author china miville engines similar to babbages serve as brains for the robotic constructs of the city of new crobuzon one such engine even develops sentient thought due to a recursive algorithmic loop the british empire of the peshawar lancers by s m stirling features a massive waterpowered analytical engine at oxford used by two of the main characters it is noted that most of the engines run on steam and that an even larger one is under construction at the british capital in delhi in the michael flynn novel in the country of the blind a secret society calling itself the babbage society secretly financed the building of babbage engines in the mid19th century in the novel the society uses the babbage engines along with a statistical science called cliology to predict and manipulate future history in the process they predict the rise of the nazis and accidentally start the us civil war in the neal stephenson novel the diamond age ubiquitous molecular nanotechnology is described to make use of rod logic similar to that imagined by babbages design for the analytical engine moriarty by modem a short story by jack nimersheim describes an alternate history where babbages analytical engine was indeed completed and had been deemed highly classified by the british government the characters of sherlock holmes and moriarty had in reality been a set of prototype programs written for the analytical engine this short story follows holmes as his program is rebooted on modern computers and he is forced to compete against his nemesis yet again in the modern counterparts of babbages analytical engine a similar setting is used by sydney padua in the webcomic the thrilling adventures of lovelace and babbage the comic is based on thorough research on the biographies of and correspondence between babbage and lovelace which is then twisted for humorous effect georgia on my mind is a novelette by charles sheffield which involves two major themes being widowed and the quest

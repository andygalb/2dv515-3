adele goldberg (computer scientist) adele goldberg born july 7 1945 is a computer scientist who participated in developing the programming language smalltalk80 and various concepts related to objectoriented programming while a researcher at the xerox palo alto research center parc in the 1970s life goldberg was born in cleveland ohio and grew up in chicago illinois she received her bachelors degree in mathematics at the university of michigan in ann arbor and a masters degree in information science from the university of chicago she received her phd in information science from the university of chicago in 1973 she completed her dissertation computerassisted instruction the application of theoremproving to adaptive response analysis while working as a research associate at stanford university goldberg began working at parc in 1973 as a laboratory and research assistant and eventually became manager of the system concepts laboratory where she alan kay and others developed smalltalk80 which both developed the objectoriented approach of simula 67 and introduced a programming environment of overlapping windows on graphic display screens not only was smalltalks innovative format simpler to use it was also customizable and objects could be transferred among applications with minimal effort along with kay she wrote the influential article personal dynamic media which predicted a world where ordinary individuals would use notebook computers to exchange modify and redistribute personal media this paper outlined the vision for the dynabook she served as president of the association for computing machinery acm from 1984 to 1986 and together with alan kay and dan ingalls received the acm software systems award in 1987 and was also included in forbess twenty who matter many of the concepts developed by goldberg and her team at parc became the basis for graphically based user interfaces replacing the earlier command line based systems according to goldberg steve jobs demanded a demonstration of the smalltalk system which she refused to give him her superiors eventually ordered her to at which point she complied satisfied that the decision to give away the kitchen sink to jobs and his team was then their responsibility apple eventually used many of the ideas in the alto and their implementations as the basis for their apple macintosh desktop environment in 1988 goldberg left parc to cofound parcplace systems a company that created development tools for smalltalkbased applications she served as parcplace systemss chairwoman and ceo until its 1995 merger with digitalk she cofounded and is currently working at neometron inc an internet support provider in 1999 of palo alto california she works at bullitics the computer history

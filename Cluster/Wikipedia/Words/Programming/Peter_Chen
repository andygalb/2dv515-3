technology in june 2011 in jeju island korea chen received the transformative achievement medal from software engineering society and the society for design and process science his innovative work initiated a new field of research and practice called conceptual modeling since 1979 an annual international professional meeting thae international conference on conceptual modeling has been held in different countries peter p chen award to recognize chens pioneering leadership role the peter p chen award was established in 2008 to honor excellent researcherseducators for outstanding contributions to the field of conceptual modeling each year the recipients of the peter p chen award are 2008 bernhard thalheim professor university of kiel germany 2009 david w embley professor

ilkay altintas chief data science officer san diego supercomputer center univ of california san diego usa work entityrelationship modeling and conceptual data modeling the entityrelationship model serves as the foundation of many systems analysis and design methodologies computeraided software engineering case tools and repository systems the er model is the basis for ibms repository managermvs and decs cddplus chens original paper chens main contributions are formalizing the concepts developing a theory with a set of data definition and manipulation operations and specifying the translation rules from the er model to several major types of databases including the relational database he also popularized the model and introduced it to the academic literature the er model was adopted as the meta model ansi standard in information resource directory system irds and the er approach has been ranked at the top methodology for database design and one of the top methodologies in systems development by several surveys of fortune 500 companies computeraided software engineering chens work is a cornerstone of software engineering the er model is also the basis for microsofts adonet entity framework the hypertext concept which makes the world wide web extremely popular is very similar to the main concept in the er model chen investigated this linkage as an invited expert of several xml working groups of the world wide web consortium w3c the er model also serves as the foundation of some of the recent work on objectoriented analysis and design methodologies and semantic web the uml modeling language has its roots in the er model computer performance modeling in his early career he was active in rd activities in computer system performance he was the program chair of an acm sigmetrics conference he developed a computer performance model for a major computer vendor his innovative research results were adopted in commercial computer performance tuning and capacity planning tools memory and storage hierarchy storage technology cdrom firmware and microprogramming his phd thesis at harvard was one of the first studies of costperformance optimization models of multilevel memorystorage hierarchies he was also one of the early microprogrammers developing the firmware for a file control unit for an ibm mainframe computer his article on cdrom in ieee proceedings journal in the 80s was one of the first articles explaining how cdrom worked when cdroms became popular he was a coauthor of the storage technology article in early versions of a computer encyclopedia book published by mcgrawhill cyber security and terrorist detection in recent years he led a multidisciplinary research team in developing new efficient and effective techniques in identifying terrorists and malicious cyber transactions at cmu he is active in the rd activities of cert coordination center and software engineering institute sei big data web services blockchain internet of things iot he is active in research and lecturing on big data and emerging technologies he was a keynote speaker and a keynote panelist on big data at ieee conferences he was the 2014

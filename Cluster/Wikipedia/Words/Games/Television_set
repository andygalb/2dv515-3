television set tv set redirects here for other uses see television set disambiguation a toshiba regza lcd television set a sony wega crt television set a television set or television receiver more commonly called a television tv tv set or telly is a device that combines a tuner display and loudspeakers for the purpose of viewing television introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form television sets became a popular consumer product after world war ii in electronic form using cathode ray tubes the addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes the ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s such as betamax vhs and later dvd it was also the display device for the first generation of home computers eg timex sinclair 1000 and video game consoles eg atari in the 1980s in the 2010s flat panel television incorporating liquidcrystal displays especially ledbacklit lcds largely replaced cathode ray tubes and other displays modern flat panel tvs are typically capable of highdefinition display 720p 1080i 1080p and can also play content from a usb device history history of television rca 630ts the first massproduced electronic television set which sold in 19461947 mechanical televisions were commercially sold from 1928 to 1934 in the united kingdom in 1926 kenjiro takayanagi demonstrated the first tv system that employed a cathode ray tube crt display at hamamatsu industrial high school in japan a television testing laboratory the first commercially made electronic televisions with cathode ray tubes were manufactured by telefunken in germany in 1934 during the first decade of the 21st century crt picture tube display technology was almost entirely supplanted worldwide by flat panel displays by the early 2010s lcd tvs which increasingly used ledbacklit lcds accounted for the overwhelming majority of television sets being manufactured display display device television sets may employ one of several available display technologies as of the mid2010s lcds overwhelmingly predominate in new merchandise but oled displays are claiming an increasing market share as they become more affordable and dlp technology continues to offer some advantages in projection systems the production of plasma and crt displays has been almost completely discontinued there are four primary competing tv technologies crt lcd multiple variations of lcd screens are called qled quantum dot led lcd tn lcd ips lcd pls lcd va etc oled plasma crt cathode ray tube a 14inch cathode ray tube showing its deflection coils and electron guns the cathode ray tube crt is a vacuum tube containing one or more electron guns a source of electrons or electron emitter and a fluorescent screen used to view images it has a means to accelerate and deflect the electron beams onto the screen to create the images the images may represent electrical waveforms oscilloscope pictures television computer monitor radar targets or others the crt uses an evacuated glass envelope which is large deep ie long from front screen face to rear end fairly heavy and relatively fragile as a matter of safety the face is typically made of thick lead glass so as to be highly shatterresistant and to block most xray emissions particularly if the crt is used in a consumer product in television sets and computer monitors the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a raster an image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three electron beams one for each additive primary color red green and blue with a video signal as a reference dlp digital light processing the christie mirage 5000 a 2001 dlp projector digital light processing dlp is a type of projector technology that uses a digital micromirror device some dlps have a tv tuner which makes them a type of tv display it was originally developed in 1987 by larry hornbeck of texas instruments while the dlp imaging device was invented by texas instruments the first dlp based projector was introduced by digital projection ltd in 1997 digital projection and texas instruments were both awarded emmy awards in 1998 for the dlp projector technology dlp is used in a variety of display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also nontraditional embedded applications including medical security and industrial uses dlp technology is used in dlp front projectors standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily dlp rear projection television sets and digital signs it is also used in about 85 of digital cinema projection and in additive manufacturing as a power source in some printers to cure resins into solid 3d objects plasma plasma display a plasma display panel pdp is a type of flat panel display common to large tv displays 30 inches 76cm or larger they are called plasma displays because the technology utilizes small cells containing electrically charged ionized gases or what are in essence chambers more commonly known as fluorescent lamps lcd liquid crystal display a generic lcd tv with speakers on either side of the screenliquidcrystaldisplay televisions lcd tv are television sets that use liquidcrystal displays to produce images lcd televisions are much thinner and lighter than cathode ray tube crts of similar display size and are available in much larger sizes eg 90 inch diagonal when manufacturing costs fell this combination of features made lcds practical for television receivers in 2007 lcd televisions surpassed sales of crtbased televisions globally for the first time lcds also have disadvantages other technologies address these weaknesses including oleds fed and sed oled organic lightemitting diode oled tv an oled organic lightemitting diode is a lightemitting diode led in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound which emits light in response to an electric current this layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes generally at least one of these electrodes is transparent oleds are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens it is also used for computer monitors portable systems such as mobile phones handheld games consoles and pdas there are two main families of oled those based on small molecules and those employing polymers adding mobile ions to an oled creates a lightemitting electrochemical cell or lec which has a slightly different mode of operation oled displays can use either passivematrix pmoled or activematrix addressing schemes activematrix oleds amoled require a thinfilm transistor backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes an oled display works without a backlight thus it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display lcd in low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an oled screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an lcd whether the lcd uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or led backlight outdoor television an outdoor television set designed for outdoor use is usually found in the outdoor sections of bars sports fields or other community facilities most outdoor televisions use highdefinition television technology their body is more robust the screens are designed to remain clearly visible even in sunny outdoor lighting the screens also have antireflective coatings to prevent glare they are weatherresistant and often also have antitheft brackets outdoor tv models can also be connected with bd players and pvrs for greater functionality recycling and disposal due to recent changes in electronic waste legislation economical and environmentally friendly television disposal has been made increasingly more available in the form of television recycling the salvage value of the materials of the set such as copper wiring in crt sets offset the costs of recycling and sometimes even positive gains worlds largest tv manufacturers global 2016 years statistics for lcd tv rank manufacturer market share headquarters 1 samsung 216 seoul south korea 2 lg electronics 119

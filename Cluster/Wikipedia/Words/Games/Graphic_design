graphic design graphic symbols are often functionalist and anonymous as these pictographs from the us national park service illustrate graphic design is the process of visual communication and problemsolving through the use of typography photography and illustration the field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design but sometimes the term graphic design is used synonymously graphic designers create and combine symbols images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages they use typography visual arts and page layout techniques to create visual compositions common uses of graphic design include corporate design logos and branding editorial design magazines newspapers and books wayfinding or environmental design advertising web design communication design product packaging and signage history history of graphic design page from the book of kells folio 114v decorated text tunc dicit illisthe term graphic design was coined by william addison dwiggins in 1922 the egyptians also invented papyrus paper made from reeds found along the nile on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time during the dark ages from 500 ad to 1450 ad monks created elaborate illustrated manuscripts in both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of visual communication in the 20th and 21st centuries the distinction between advertising art graphic design and fine art has disappeared they share many elements theories principles practices languages and sometimes the same benefactor or client in advertising the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services in graphic design the essence is to give order to information form to ideas expression and feeling to artifacts that document human experience graphic design in the united states began with benjamin franklin who used his newspaper the pennsylvania gazette to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses benjamin franklins ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in pennsylvania andrew bradford as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won he showed his prowess by running an ad in his general magazine and the historical chronicle of british plantations in america the precursor to the saturday evening post that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented named called the pennsylvania fireplace his invention is still sold today and is known as the franklin stove american advertising initially imitated british newspapers and magazines advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read franklin better organized this by adding 14point type for the first line of the advertisement although later shortened and centered it making headlines franklin added illustrations something that london printers had not attempted franklin was the first to utilize logos which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products some advertisements ran for 1020 lines including color names varieties and sizes of the goods that were offered the advent of printing history of printing during the tang dynasty 618907 wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce buddhist texts a buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book beginning in the 11th century longer scrolls and books were produced using movable type printing making books widely available during the song dynasty 9601279 during the 17th18th century movable type was used for handbills or trade cards which were printed from wood or copper engravings these documents announced a business and its location english painter william hogarth used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade in mainz germany in 1448 johann gutenberg introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a printing press and opened a new era of commerce this made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly previously most advertising was word of mouth in france and england for example criers announced products for sale just as ancient romans had done the printing press made books more widely available aldus manutius developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design this era of graphic design is called humanist or old style additionally william caxton englands first printer produced religious books but had trouble selling them he discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors this practice was termed squis or pin up posters in approximately 1612 becoming the first form of print advertising in europe the term siquis came from the roman era when public notices were posted stating if anybody which is latin for si quis these printed announcements were followed by later public registers of wants called want ads and in some areas such as the first periodical in paris advertising was termed advices the advices were what we know today as want ad media or advice columns in 1638 harvard university received a printing press from england more than 52 years passed before london bookseller benjamin harris received another printing press in boston harris published a newspaper in serial form publick occurrences both foreign and domestick it was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition john campbell is credited for the first newspaper the boston newsletter which appeared in 1704 the paper was known during the revolution as weeklies the name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper the solution was to first print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication the paper was four pages long having ads on at least 2030 of the total paper pages one and four the hot news was located on the inside the initial use of the boston newsletter carried campbells own solicitations for advertising from his readers campbells first paid advertisement was in his third edition may 7 or 8th 1704 two of the first ads were for stolen anvils the third was for real estate in oyster bay owned by william bradford a pioneer printer in new york and the first to sell something of value bradford published his first newspaper in 1725 new yorks first the newyork gazette bradfords son preceded him in philadelphia publishing the american weekly mercury 1719 the mercury and william brookers massachusetts gazette first published a day earlier design industry in late 19thcentury europe especially in the united kingdom the first official publication of a printed design was released marking the separation of graphic design from fine art in 1849 henry cole became one of the major forces in design education in great britain informing the government of the importance of design in his journal of design and manufactures he organized the great exhibition as a celebration of modern industrial technology and victorian design from 1891 to 1896 william morris kelmscott press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the arts and crafts movement and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art the kelmscott press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles this historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenthcentury graphic design morris work along with the rest of the private press movement directly influenced art nouveau twentieth century design a boeing 747 aircraft with livery designating it as air force one the cyan forms the us flag presidential seal and the caslon lettering were all designed at different times by different designers for different purposes and combined by designer raymond loewy in this one single aircraft exterior design the term graphic design first appeared in print in the 1922 essay new kind of printing calls for new design by william addison dwiggins an american book designer in the early 20th century the signage in the london underground is a classic design example of the modern era and used a typeface designed by edward johnston in 1916 in the 1920s soviet constructivism applied intellectual production in different spheres of production the movement saw individualistic art as useless in revolutionary russia and thus moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes they designed buildings theater sets posters fabrics clothing furniture logos menus etc jan tschichold codified the principles of modern typography in his 1928 book new typography the postworld war ii american economy revealed a greater need for graphic design mainly in advertising and packaging the spread of the german bauhaus school of design to chicago in 1937 brought a massproduced minimalism to america sparking modern architecture and design notable names in midcentury modern design include adrian frutiger designer of the typefaces univers and frutiger paul rand who took the principles of the bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design helping to create a uniquely american approach to european minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as corporate identity alex steinweiss credited with the invention of the album cover and josef mllerbrockmann who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era the professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with consumerism this raised concerns and criticisms notably from within the graphic design community with the first things first manifesto first launched by ken garland in 1964 it was republished as the first things first 2000 manifesto in 1999 in the magazine emigre 51 both editions attracted signatures from practitioners and thinkers such as rudy vanderlans erik spiekermann ellen lupton and rick poynor the 2000 manifesto was also published in adbusters known for its strong critiques of visual culture applications colour graphic design is applied to everything visual from road signs to technical schematics from interoffice memorandums to reference manuals design can aid in selling a product or idea it is applied to products and elements of company identity such as logos colors packaging and text as part of branding see also advertising branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers graphic designers often form part of a branding team graphic design is applied in the entertainment industry in decoration scenery and visual story telling other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels vinyl album covers comic books dvd covers opening credits and closing credits in filmmaking and programs and props on stage this could also include artwork used for tshirts and other items screenprinted for sale from scientific journals to news reporting the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information known as information design newspapers magazines blogs television and film documentaries may use graphic design with the advent of the web information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories information design can include data visualization which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation and can be tied in with information graphics skills a graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing text and either preexisting imagery or images developed by the graphic designer elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form which involves the use of visual arts typography and page layout techniques graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces designers use digital tools often referred to as interactive design or multimedia design designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs the process school is concerned with communication it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these message the semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers produces meaning communication as an agent typography typography typography includes type design modifying type glyphs and arranging type type glyphs characters are created and modified using illustration techniques type arrangement is the selection of typefaces point size tracking the space between all characters used kerning the space between two specific characters and leading line spacing typography is performed by typesetters compositors typographers graphic artists art directors and clerical workers until the digital age typography was a specialized occupation certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions for example 1942 report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report page layout page layout golden section in book design page layout deals with the arrangement of elements content on a page such as image placement text layout and style page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages elements typically consist of type text images pictures and with print media occasionally placeholder graphics such as a dieline for elements that are not printed with ink such as dielaser cutting foil stamping or blind embossing printmaking printmaking printmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on paper and other materials or surfaces the process is capable of producing multiples of the same work each called a print each print is an original technically known as an impression prints are created from a single original surface technically a matrix common types of matrices include plates of metal usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching stone used for lithography blocks of wood for woodcuts linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screenprinting works printed from a single plate create an edition in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition prints may be published in book form as artists books a single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques the pencil is one of the most basic graphic design tools aside from technology graphic design requires judgment and creativity critical observational quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and rendering if the executor is merely following a solution eg sketch script or instructions provided by another designer such as an art director then the executor is not usually considered the designer tools the method of presentation eg arrangements style medium is important to the design the development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project the image or layout is produced using traditional media and guides or digital image editing tools on computers tools in computer graphics often take on traditional names such as scissors or pen some graphic design tools such as a grid are used in both traditional and digital form in the mid1980s desktop publishing and graphic art software applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes and to simulate the effects of traditional media traditional tools such as pencils can be useful even when computers are used for finalization a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the creative process computers and software designers disagree whether computers enhance the creative process while other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome most designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computerbased technologies first handrendered layouts are used to get approval to execute an idea then the polished visual product is produced on a computer graphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for imagemaking typography and layout nearly all of the popular and industry standard software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of adobe systems incorporated adobe photoshop a rasterbased program for photo editing and adobe illustrator a vectorbased program for drawing are often used in the final stage designers often use predesigned raster images and vector graphics in their work from online design databases raster images may be edited in adobe photoshop logos and illustrations in adobe illustrator and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs such as adobe indesign serif pageplus and quarkxpress powerful opensource programs which are free are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design these include inkscape for vector graphics gimp for photoediting and image manipulation krita for painting and scribus for page layout related design fields interface design user interface design since the advent of personal computers many graphic designers have become involved in interface design in an environment commonly referred to as a graphical user interface gui this has included web design and software design when end user interactivity is a design consideration of the layout or interface combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding graphic designers often work with software developers and web developers to create the look and feel of a web site or software application an important aspect of interface design is icon design user experience design user experience design user experience design is the study analysis and development of a persons interaction with a company or its products experiential graphic design environmental graphic design experiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment this area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings as such it is a crossdisciplinary collaborative process involving designers fabricators city planners architects manufacturers and construction teams experiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are wayfinding placemaking branded environments exhibitions and museum displays public installations and digital environments occupations graphic design occupations graphic design career paths cover all parts of the creative spectrum and often overlap workers perform specialized tasks such as design services publishing advertising and public relations as of 2017 median pay was 48700 per year the main job titles within the industry are often country specific they can include graphic designer art director creative director animator and entry level production artist depending on the industry served the responsibilities may have different titles such as dtp associate or graphic artist the responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as illustration photography animation or interactive design employment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35 by 2026 while employment in traditional media such as newspaper and book design expect to go down by 22 graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques programs and methods graphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry such as design consultancies or branding agencies others may work within publishing marketing or other communications companies especially since the introduction of personal computers many graphic designers work as inhouse designers in nondesign oriented organizations graphic designers may also work freelance working on their own terms prices ideas etc a graphic designer typically reports to the art director creative director or senior media creative as a designer becomes more senior they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities such as brand development and corporate identity development they are often expected to interact more directly with clients for example taking and interpreting briefs crowdsourcing in graphic design crowdsourcing creative work jeff howe of wired magazine first used the term crowdsourcing in his 2006 article the rise of crowdsourcing it spans such creative domains as graphic design architecture apparel design writing illustration etc tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent an example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster an example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design visual arts portal

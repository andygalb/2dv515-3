the trademark digital was a major american company in the computer industry from the 1950s to the 1990s dec was a leading vendor of computer systems including computers software and peripherals their pdp and successor vax products were the most successful of all minicomputers in terms of sales dec was acquired in june 1998 by compaq in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry at the time compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors dec was a major player overseas where compaq had less presence however compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions pdp11 vax and alphaserver systems were still produced under the hp name history history of digital equipment corporation from 1957 until 1992 decs headquarters were located in a former wool mill in maynard massachusetts since renamed clock tower place and now home to many companies dec was acquired in june 1998 by compaq which subsequently merged with hewlettpackard hp in may 2002 some parts of dec notably the compiler business and the hudson massachusetts facility were sold to intel initially focusing on the small end of the computer market allowed dec to grow without its potential competitors making serious efforts to compete with them their pdp series of machines became popular in the 1960s especially the pdp8 widely considered to be the first successful minicomputer looking to simplify and update their line dec replaced most of their smaller machines with the pdp11 in 1970 eventually selling over 600000 units and cementing decs position in the industry originally designed as a followon to the pdp11 decs vax11 series was the first widely used 32bit minicomputer sometimes referred to as superminis these systems were able to compete in many roles with larger mainframe computers such as the ibm system370 the vax was a bestseller with over 400000 sold and its sales through the 1980s propelled the company into the second largest computer company in the industry at its peak dec was the second largest employer in massachusetts second only to the massachusetts state government the rapid rise of the business microcomputer in the late 1980s and especially the introduction of powerful 32bit systems in the 1990s quickly eroded the value of decs systems decs last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly changing market was the dec alpha 64bit risc instruction set architecture dec initially started work on alpha as a way to reimplement their vax series but also employed it in a range of highperformance workstations although the alpha processor family met both of these goals and for most of its lifetime was the fastest processor family on the market extremely high asking prices were outsold by lower priced x86 chips from intel and clones such as amd dec was acquired in june 1998 by compaq in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry some of decs product lines were still produced under the hp name products dec vaxstation beyond decsystem1020 pdp vax and alpha dec was well respected for its communication subsystem designs such as ethernet dna digital network architecture predominantly decnet products dsa digital storage architecture diskstapescontrollers and its dumb terminal subsystems including vt100 and decserver products research decs research laboratories or research labs as they were commonly known conducted decs corporate research some of them were operated by compaq and are still operated by hewlettpackard the laboratories were western research laboratory wrl in palo alto california us systems research center src in palo alto california us network systems laboratory nsl in palo alto california us cambridge research laboratory crl in cambridge massachusetts us paris research laboratory prl in paris france metrowest technology campus mtc in maynard massachusetts us some of the former employees of decs research labs or decs rd in

daniel w dobberpuhl jim keller rich witek some of the work of the research labs was published in the digital technical journal accomplishments and legacy dec supported the ansi standards especially the ascii character set which survives in unicode and the iso 8859 character set family decs own multinational character set also had a large influence on iso 88591 latin1 and by extension unicode software the first versions of the c language and the unix operating system ran on decs pdp series of computers first on a pdp7 then the pdp11s which were among the first commercially viable minicomputers although for several years dec itself did not encourage the use of unix dec produced widely used and influential interactive operating systems including os8 tops10 tops20 rstse rsx11 rt11 and openvms pdp computers in particular the pdp11 model inspired a generation of programmers and software developers some pdp11 systems more than 25 years old software and hardware are still being used to control and monitor factories transportation systems and nuclear plants dec was an early champion of timesharing systems the commandline interfaces found in decs systems eventually codified as dcl would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer clis those used in earlier systems such as ctss ibms jcl or univacs timesharing systems would look utterly alien many features of the cpm and msdos cli show a recognizable family resemblance to decs oses including command names such as dir and help and the namedotextension file naming conventions notes11 and its followon product vax notes were two of the first examples of online collaboration software a category that has become to be known as groupware len kawell one of the original notes11 developers later joined lotus development corporation and contributed to their lotus notes product the mumps programming language with its builtin database was developed on the pdp7 9 and 15 series machines mumps is still widely used in medical informations systems such as those provide by meditech and epic systems hardware vax and microvax computers very widespread in the 1980s running vms formed one of the most important proprietary networks decnet which linked business and research facilities the decnet protocols formed one of the first peertopeer networking standards with decnet phase i being released in the mid1970s email file sharing and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market the la36 and la120 dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the teletype corporation the vt100 computer terminal became the industry standard implementing a useful subset of the ansi x364 standard and even today terminal emulators such as hyperterminal putty and xterm still emulate a vt100 or its more capable successor the vt220 dec invented digital linear tape dlt formerly known as compactape which began as a compact backup medium for microvax systems and later grew to capacities of 800 gigabytes work on the first harddiskbased mp3player the personal jukebox started at the dec systems research center the project was started about a month before the merger into compaq was completed decs western research lab created the itsy pocket computer this was developed into the compaq ipaq line of pdas which replaced the compaq aero pda networking dec intel and xerox through their collaboration to create the dix standard were champions of ethernet but dec is the company that made ethernet commercially successful initially ethernetbased decnet and lat protocols interconnected vaxes with decserver terminal servers starting with the unibus to ethernet adapter multiple generations of ethernet hardware from dec were the de facto standard the ci computer interconnect adapter was the industrys first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive rings dec also invented clustering an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the hsc507090 and later series of hierarchical storage controllers hsc the hscs delivered the first hardware raid 0 and raid 1 capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies this technology was the forerunner to architectures such as network of workstations which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as websearches and drug research the x window system the network transparent window system used on unix and linux and also available on other operating systems was developed at mit jointly between project athena and the laboratory for computer science dec was the primary sponsor for this project which was a contemporary of the gnu project but not associated with it in the period 199499 linus torvalds developed versions of linux on early alphaserver systems made available to him by the engineering department another distribution that ran on alpha was gentoo linux dec was one of the first businesses connected to the internet with deccom registered in 1985 the popular altavista created by dec was one of the first comprehensive internet search engines although lycos was earlier it was much more limited dec once held the class a ip address block 160008 corporate digital federal credit union dcu is a credit union which was chartered in 1979 for employees of dec today its field of membership is open to existing family members over 900 different sponsors several communities in massachusetts and several organizations dcu has over 700 different sponsors including the companies that acquired pieces of dec matrix management user organizations decus logodigital

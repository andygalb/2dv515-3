aliens or player a game will also end if the players last laser base is destroyed development space invaders was created by tomohiro nishikado who spent a year designing the game and developing the necessary hardware to produce it early enemy designs included tanks combat planes and battleships hardware because microcomputers in japan were not powerful enough at the time to perform the complex tasks involved in designing and programming space invaders nishikado had to design his own custom hardware and development tools for the game space invaders was first released in a cocktailtable format with black and white graphics while the western release by midway was in an upright cabinet format the upright cabinet uses strips of orange and green cellophane over the screen to simulate color graphics the graphics are reflected onto a painted backdrop of a moon against a starry background music despite its simplicity the music to space invaders was revolutionary in the gaming industry videogame scholar andrew schartmann identifies three aspects of the music that would have a significant impact on the development of game music whereas video game music prior to space invaders was restricted to the extremities ie a short introductory theme with gameover counterpart the alieninspired hit featured continuous musicthe wellknown fournote loopthroughout uninterrupted by sound effects it was thus the first time that sound effects and music were superimposed to form a rich sonic landscape not only do players receive feedback related directly to their actions through sound effects they also receive stimulus in a more subtle noninteractive fashion through music the music interacts with onscreen animation to influence the emotions of the player that seemingly pedestrian fournote loop might stir us in the most primitive of ways but that it stirs us at all is worthy of note by demonstrating that game sound could be more than a simple tune to fill the silence space invaders moved video game music closer to the realm of art the music popularized the notion of variabilitythe idea that music can change in accordance with the ongoing narrative the variable in space invaders tempo is admittedly simple but its implications are not to be underestimated over the years analogous strategies of variation would be applied to pitch rhythm dynamics form and a host of other parameters all with the goal of accommodating the nonlinear aspect of video games mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote

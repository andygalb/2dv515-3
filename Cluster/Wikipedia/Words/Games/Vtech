unencrypted plaintext failed to securely hash or salt passwords the attack leveraged an sql injection to gain privileged root access to vtech servers once privileged access was acquired the attacker exfiltrated the data including some 190 gigabytes of photographs of children and adults detailed chat logs between parents and children which spanned over the course of years and voice recordings all unencrypted and stored in plain text the attacker shared some 3832 image files with the journalist for verification purposes and some redacted photographs were published by the journalist commenting

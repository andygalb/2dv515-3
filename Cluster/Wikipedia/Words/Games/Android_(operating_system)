android (operating system) for other uses see android disambiguation android is a mobile operating system developed by google based on a modified version of the linux kernel and other open source software and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets in addition google has further developed android tv for televisions android auto for cars and wear os for wrist watches each with a specialized user interface variants of android are also used on game consoles digital cameras pcs and other electronics initially developed by android inc which google bought in 2005 android was unveiled in 2007 with the first commercial android device launched in september 2008 the operating system has since gone through multiple major releases with the current version being 9 pie released in august 2018 the core android source code is known as android open source project aosp and is primarily licensed under the apache license android is also associated with a suite of proprietary software developed by google called google mobile services gms that very frequently comes preinstalled in devices which usually includes the google chrome web browser and google search and always includes core apps for services such as gmail as well as the application store and digital distribution platform google play and associated development platform these apps are licensed by manufacturers of android devices certified under standards imposed by google but aosp has been used as the basis of competing android ecosystems such as amazoncoms fire os which use their own equivalents to gms android has been the bestselling os worldwide on smartphones since 2011 and on tablets since 2013 as of may2017 history see also android version history the name andrew and the noun android share the greek root andros which means man andy rubin picked androidcom as his personal website and his colleagues used android as his nickname at work that eventually became the name of the company he founded and the name of the operating system they developed running a prerelease version of android android inc was founded in palo alto california in october 2003 by andy rubin rich miner nick sears and chris white rubin had difficulty attracting investors early on and android was facing eviction from its office space steve perlman a close friend of rubin brought him 10000 in cash in an envelope and shortly thereafter wired an undisclosed amount as seed funding perlman refused a stake in the company and has stated i did it because i believed in the thing and i wanted to help andy in july 2005 speculation about googles intention to enter the mobile communications market continued to build through december 2006 htc dream or tmobile g1 the first commercially released device running android 2008 on november 5 2007 the open handset alliance a consortium of technology companies including google device manufacturers such as htc motorola and samsung wireless carriers such as sprint and tmobile and chipset makers such as qualcomm and texas instruments unveiled itself with a goal to develop the first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices since 2008 android has seen numerous updates which have incrementally improved the operating system adding new features and fixing bugs in previous releases each major release is named in alphabetical order after a dessert or sugary treat with the first few android versions being called cupcake donut eclair and froyo in that order during its announcement of android kitkat in 2013 google explained that since these devices make our lives so sweet each android version is named after a dessert although a google spokesperson told cnn in an interview that its kind of like an internal team thing and we prefer to be a little bit how should i say a bit inscrutable in the matter ill say in 2010 google launched its nexus series of devices a lineup in which google partnered with different device manufacturers to produce new devices and introduce new android versions the series was described as having played a pivotal role in androids history by introducing new software iterations and hardware standards across the board and became known for its bloatfree software with timely updates eric schmidt andy rubin and hugo barra at a 2012 press conference announcing googles nexus 7 tablet from 2008 to 2013 hugo barra served as product spokesperson representing android at press conferences and google io googles annual developerfocused conference he left google in august 2013 to join chinese phone maker xiaomi in june 2014 google announced android one a set of hardware reference models that would allow google introduced the pixel and pixel xl smartphones in october 2016 marketed as being the first phones made by google features see also list of features in android interface androids default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation using touch inputs that loosely correspond to realworld actions like swiping tapping pinching and reverse pinching to manipulate onscreen objects along with a virtual keyboard android devices boot to the homescreen the primary navigation and information hub on android devices analogous to the desktop found on personal computers android homescreens are typically made up of app icons and widgets app icons launch the associated app whereas widgets display live autoupdating content such as a weather forecast the users email inbox or a news ticker directly on the homescreen along the top of the screen is a status bar showing information about the device and its connectivity this status bar can be pulled down to reveal a notification screen where apps display important information or updates an all apps screen lists all installed applications with the ability for users to drag an app from the list onto the home screen a recents screen lets users switch between recently used apps applications see also android software development and google play applications apps which extend the functionality of devices are written using the android software development kit sdk the sdk includes a comprehensive set of development tools android has a growing selection of thirdparty applications which can be acquired by users by downloading and installing the applications apk android application package file or by downloading them using an application store program that allows users to install update and remove applications from their devices google play store is the primary application store installed on android devices that comply with googles compatibility requirements and license the google mobile services software as of may 2017 there are over one billion active users a month for gmail android chrome google play and maps due to the open nature of android a number of thirdparty application marketplaces also exist for android either to provide a substitute for devices that are not allowed to ship with google play store provide applications that cannot be offered on google play store due to policy violations or for other reasons examples of these thirdparty stores have included the amazon appstore getjar and slideme fdroid another alternative marketplace seeks to only provide applications that are distributed under free and open source licenses memory management since android devices are usually batterypowered android is designed to manage processes to keep power consumption at a minimum when an application is not in use the system suspends its operation so that while available for immediate use rather than closed it does not use battery power or cpu resources hardware see also android hardware requirements the main hardware platform for android is arm the armv7 and armv8a architectures with x86 and x8664 architectures also officially supported in later versions of android requirements for the minimum amount of ram for devices running android71 range from in practice 2 gb for best hardware down to 1 gb for the most common screen to absolute minimum 512 mb for the lowest spec 32bit smartphone the recommendation for android44 is to have at least 512mb of ram android devices incorporate many optional hardware components including still or video cameras gps orientation sensors dedicated gaming controls accelerometers gyroscopes barometers magnetometers proximity sensors pressure sensors thermometers and touchscreens some hardware components are not required but became standard in certain classes of devices such as smartphones and additional requirements apply if they are present some other hardware was initially required but those requirements have been relaxed or eliminated altogether for example as android was developed initially as a phone os hardware such as microphones were required while over time the phone function became optional if present at all since the camera was dropped as a requirement entirely when android started to be used on settop boxes in addition to running on smartphones and tablets several vendors run android natively on regular pc hardware with a keyboard and mouse development android software development the stack of android open source project android is developed by google until the latest changes and updates are ready to be released at which point the source code is made available to the android open source project aosp as a result most android devices including googles own ultimately ship with a combination of free and open source and proprietary software with the software required for accessing google services falling into the latter category update schedule see also android version history google announces major incremental upgrades to android on a yearly basis the latest major release is 9 pie compared to its primary rival mobile operating system apples ios android updates typically reach various devices with significant delays except for devices within the google nexus and pixel brands updates often arrive months after the release of the new version or not at all the extensive variation of hardware in android devices causes significant delays for software upgrades with new versions of the operating system and security patches typically taking months before reaching consumers or sometimes not at all the lack of aftersale support from manufacturers and carriers has been widely criticized by consumer groups and the technology media in 2012 google began decoupling certain aspects of the operating system particularly its core applications so they could be updated through the google play store independently of the os one of those components google play services is a closedsource systemlevel process providing apis for google services installed automatically on nearly all devices running android 22 froyo and higher with these changes google can add new system functionality through play services and update apps without having to distribute an upgrade to the operating system itself in may 2016 bloomberg reported that google was making efforts to keep android more uptodate including accelerated rates of security updates rolling out technological workarounds reducing requirements for phone testing and ranking phone makers in an attempt to shame them into better behavior as stated by bloomberg as smartphones get more capable complex and hackable having the latest software work closely with the hardware is increasingly important hiroshi lockheimer the android lead admitted that its not an ideal situation further commenting that the lack of updates is the weakest link on security on android wireless carriers were described in the report as the most challenging discussions due to carriers slow approval time due to testing on their networks despite some carriers including verizon and sprint having already shortened their respective approval times htcs thenexecutive jason mackenzie called monthly security updates unrealistic in 2015 and google was trying to persuade carriers to exclude security patches from the full testing procedures in a further effort for persuasion google shared a list of top phone makers measured by updated devices with its android partners and is considering making the list public mike chan cofounder of phone maker nextbit and former android developer said that the best way to solve this problem is a massive rearchitecture of the operating system or google could invest in training manufacturers and carriers to be good android citizens in may 2017 with the announcement of android 80 google introduced project treble a major rearchitect of the android os framework designed to make it easier faster and less costly for manufacturers to update devices to newer versions of android project treble separates the vendor implementation devicespecific lowerlevel software written by silicon manufacturers from the android os framework via a new vendor interface in android 70 and earlier no formal vendor interface exists so device makers must update large portions of the android code to move a device to a newer version of the operating system with treble the new stable vendor interface provides access to the hardwarespecific parts of android enabling device makers to deliver new android releases simply by updating the android os framework without any additional work required from the silicon manufacturers in september 2017 googles project treble team revealed that as part of their efforts to improve the security lifecycle of android devices google had managed to get the linux foundation to agree to extend the support lifecycle of the linux longterm support lts kernel branch from the 2 years that it has historically lasted to 6 years for future versions of the lts kernel starting with linux kernel 44 linux kernel androids kernel is based on the linux kernels longterm support lts branches as of 2018 android targets versions 44 49 or 414 of the linux kernel androids variant of the linux kernel has further architectural changes that are implemented by google outside the typical linux kernel development cycle such as the inclusion of components like device trees ashmem ion and different out of memory oom handling in august 2011 linus torvalds said that eventually android and linux would come back to a common kernel but it will probably not be for four to five years the flash storage on android devices is split into several partitions such as system for the operating system itself and data for user data and application installations android is a linux distribution according to the linux foundation with the release of android oreo in 2017 google began to require that devices shipped with new socs had linux kernel version 44 or newer for security reasons existing devices upgraded to oreo and new products launched with older socs were exempt from this rule software stack androids architecture diagramon top of the linux kernel there are the middleware libraries and apis written in c and application software running on an application framework which includes javacompatible libraries development of the linux kernel continues independently of androids other source code projects android uses android runtime art as its runtime environment introduced in version 44 which uses aheadoftime aot compilation to entirely compile the application bytecode into machine code upon the installation of an application in android44 art was an experimental feature and not enabled by default it became the only runtime option in the next major version of android 50 for its java library the android platform uses a subset of the now discontinued apache harmony project androids standard c library bionic was developed by google specifically for android as a derivation of the bsds standard c library code bionic itself has been designed with several major features specific to the linux kernel the main benefits of using bionic instead of the gnu c library glibc or uclibc are its smaller runtime footprint and optimization for lowfrequency cpus at the same time bionic is licensed under the terms of the bsd licence which google finds more suitable for the androids overall licensing model aiming for a different licensing model toward the end of 2012 google switched the bluetooth stack in android from the gpllicensed bluez to the apachelicensed bluedroid android does not have a native x window system by default nor does it support the full set of standard gnu libraries this made it difficult to port existing linux applications or libraries to android in current versions of android toybox a collection of command line utilities mostly for use by apps as android doesnt provide a command line interface by default is used since the release of marshmallow replacing a similar toolbox collection found in previous android versions android has another operating system trusty os within it as a part of trusty software components supporting a trusted execution environment tee on mobile devices trusty and the trusty api are subject to change opensource community androids source code is released by google under an open source license and its open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the opensource code as a foundation for communitydriven projects which deliver updates to older devices add new features for advanced users or bring android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems historically device manufacturers and mobile carriers have typically been unsupportive of thirdparty firmware development manufacturers express concern about improper functioning of devices running unofficial software and the support costs resulting from this security and privacy see also mobile security and warrior pride scope of surveillance by public institutions as part of the broader 2013 mass surveillance disclosures it was revealed in september 2013 that the american and british intelligence agencies the national security agency nsa and government communications headquarters gchq respectively have access to the user data on iphone blackberry and android devices they are reportedly able to read almost all smartphone information including sms location emails and notes the documents revealed a further effort by the intelligence agencies to intercept google maps searches and queries submitted from android and other smartphones to collect location information in bulk leaked documents published by wikileaks codenamed vault 7 and dated from 20132016 detail the capabilities of the central intelligence agency cia to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare including the ability to compromise the operating systems of most smartphones including android common security threats research from security company trend micro lists premium service abuse as the most common type of android malware where text messages are sent from infected phones to premiumrate telephone numbers without the consent or even knowledge of the user other malware displays unwanted and intrusive advertisements on the device or sends personal information to unauthorised third parties in august 2015 google announced that devices in the google nexus series would begin to receive monthly security patches google also wrote that nexus devices will continue to receive major updates for at least two years and security patches for the longer of three years from initial availability or 18 months from last sale of the device via the google store in a march 2017 post on googles security blog android security leads adrian ludwig and mel miller wrote that more than 735 million devices from 200 manufacturers received a platform security update in 2016 and that our carrier and hardware partners helped expand deployment of these updates releasing updates for over half of the top 50 devices worldwide in the last quarter of 2016 they also wrote that about half of devices in use at the end of 2016 had not received a platform security update in the previous year stating that their work would continue to focus on streamlining the security updates program for easier deployment by manufacturers patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lowerpriced devices android smartphones have the ability to report the location of wifi access points encountered as phone users move around to build databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of millions of such access points these databases form electronic maps to locate smartphones allowing them to run apps like foursquare google latitude facebook places and to deliver locationbased ads technical security features android applications run in a sandbox an isolated area of the system that does not have access to the rest of the systems resources unless access permissions are explicitly granted by the user when the application is installed however this may not be possible for preinstalled apps it is not possible for example to turn off the microphone access of the preinstalled camera app without disabling the camera completely this is valid also in android versions 7 and 8 since february 2012 google has used its google bouncer malware scanner to watch over and scan apps available in the google play store before installing an application the google play store displays a list of the requirements an app needs to function after reviewing these permissions the user can choose to accept or refuse them installing the application only if they accept in september 2014 jason nova of android authority reported on a study by the german security company fraunhofer aisec in antivirus software and malware threats on android nova wrote that the android operating system deals with software packages by sandboxing them this does not allow applications to list the directory contents of other apps to keep the system safe by not allowing the antivirus to list the directories of other apps after installation applications that show no inherent suspicious behavior when downloaded are cleared as safe if then later on parts of the app are activated that turn out to be malicious the antivirus will have no way to know since it is inside the app and out of the antivirus jurisdiction the study by fraunhofer aisec examining antivirus software from avast avg bitdefender eset fsecure kaspersky lookout mcafee formerly intel security norton sophos and trend micro revealed that the tested antivirus apps do not provide protection against customized malware or targeted attacks and that the tested antivirus apps were also not able to detect malware which is completely unknown to date but does not make any efforts to hide its malignity in august 2013 google announced android device manager renamed find my device in may 2017 licensing the source code for android is opensource it is developed in private by google with the source code released publicly when a new version of android is released google publishes most of the code including network and telephony stacks under the noncopyleft apache license version 20 which allows modification and redistribution only the base android operating system including some applications is opensource software whereas most android devices ship with a substantial amount of proprietary software such as google mobile services which includes applications such as google play store google search and google play services a software layer that provides apis for the integration with googleprovided services among others these applications must be licensed from google by device makers and can only be shipped on devices which meet its compatibility guidelines and other requirements richard stallman and the free software foundation have been critical of android and have recommended the usage of alternatives such as replicant because drivers and firmware vital for the proper functioning of android devices are usually proprietary and because the google play store application can forcibly install or uninstall applications and as a result invite nonfree software although the free software foundation has not found google to use it for malicious reasons leverage over manufacturers google licenses their google mobile services software along with android trademarks only to hardware manufacturers for devices that meet googles compatibility standards specified in the android compatibility program document some stock applications and components in aosp code that were formerly used by earlier versions of android such as search music calendar and the location api were abandoned by google in favor of nonfree replacements distributed through play store google search google play music and google calendar and google play services which are no longer opensource moreover opensource variants of some applications also exclude functions that are present in their nonfree versions such as photosphere panoramas in camera and a google now page on the default home screen exclusive to the proprietary version google now launcher whose code is embedded within that of the main google application in march 2018 it was reported that google had begun to block uncertified android devices from using google mobile services software and display a warning indicating that the device manufacturer has preloaded google apps and services without certification from google users of custom roms are able to register their device id to their google account to remove this block members of the open handset alliance which include the majority of android oems are also contractually forbidden from producing android devices based on forks of the os reception android received a lukewarm reaction when it was unveiled in 2007 although analysts were impressed with the respected technology companies that had partnered with google to form the open handset alliance it was unclear whether mobile phone manufacturers would be willing to replace their existing operating systems with android since then android has grown to become the most widely used smartphone operating system despite androids popularity including an activation rate three times that of ios there have been reports that google has not been able to leverage their other products and web services successfully to turn android into the money maker that analysts had expected android has suffered from fragmentation market share usage share of operating systems research company canalys estimated in the second quarter of 2009 that android had a 28 share of worldwide smartphone shipments by the third quarter of 2011 gartner estimated that more than half 525 of the smartphone sales belonged to android in july 2011 google said that 550000 android devices were being activated every day android market share varies by location in july 2012 mobile subscribers aged 13 in the united states using android were up to 52 as of february2017 android devices account for more than half of smartphone sales in most markets including the us while only in japan was apple on top septembernovember 2013 numbers according to statcounter which tracks only the use for browsing the web android is the most popular mobile operating system since august 2013 while android phones in the western world commonly include googles proprietary addons such as google play to the otherwise opensource operating system this is increasingly not the case in emerging markets abi research claims that 65 million devices shipped globally with opensource android in the second quarter of according to a january 2015 gartner report android surpassed a billion shipments of devices in 2014 and will continue to grow at a doubledigit pace in 2015 with a 26 percent increase year over year this made it the first time that any generalpurpose operating system has reached more than one billion end users within a year by reaching close to 116 billion end users in 2014 android shipped over four times more than ios and osx combined and over three times more than microsoft windows gartner expected the whole mobile phone market to reach two billion units in 2016 including android according to a statisticas estimate android smartphones had an installed base of 18 billion units in 2015 which was 76 of the estimated total number of smartphones worldwide in the second quarter of 2014 androids share of the global smartphone shipment market was 847 a new record according to an april 2017 statcounter report android overtook microsoft windows to become the most popular operating system for total internet usage in september 2015 google announced that android had 14billion monthly active users adoption on tablets the firstgeneration nexus 7 tablet running android 41 jelly bean despite its success on smartphones initially android tablet adoption was slow despite app support in its infancy a considerable number of android tablets like the barnes noble nook alongside those using other operating systems such as the hp touchpad and blackberry playbook were rushed out to market in an attempt to capitalize on the success of the ipad this began to change in 2012 with the release of the affordable nexus7 and a push by google for developers to write better tablet applications barnes noble nook running android as of the end of 2013 over 1916 million android tablets had sold in three years since 2011 according to statcounters web use statistics as of august 15 2017 android

challenges in europe european union vs google in 2013 fairsearch a lobbying organization supported by microsoft oracle and others filed a complaint regarding android with the european commission alleging that its freeofcharge distribution model constituted anticompetitive predatory pricing the free software foundation europe whose donors include google disputed the fairsearch allegations on october 16 2018 google announced that it would change its distribution model for google mobile services in the eu since part of its revenues streams for android which came through use of google search and chrome were now prohibited by the eus ruling while the core android system remains free oems in europe would be required purchase a paid license to the core suite of google applications such as

thirdparty alternatives on phones and devices sold to customers if they so choose oems will no longer be barred from selling any device running incompatible versions of android in europe others in addition to lawsuits against google directly various proxy wars have been waged against android indirectly by targeting manufacturers of android devices with the effect of discouraging manufacturers from adopting the platform by increasing the costs of bringing an android device to market google has publicly expressed its frustration for the current patent landscape in the united states accusing

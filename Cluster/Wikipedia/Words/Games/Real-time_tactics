tactics characteristics typical realtime strategy titles encourage the player to focus on logistics and production as much as or more than combat whereas realtime tactics games commonly do not feature resourcegathering production basebuilding or economic management and usually by the provision of a realistic or at least believable representation of military tactics and operations this contrasts with other current strategy game genres for instance in largescale turnbased strategy games battles are generally abstracted and the gameplay close to that of related board games realtime strategy games deemphasize realism and focus on the collection and conversion of resources into production capacities which manufacture combat units thereafter used in generally highly stylized confrontations in contrast realtime tactics games military tactical and realistic focus and comparatively short riskreward cycle usually provide a distinctly more immediate intense and accessible experience of battlefield tactics and mle than strategy games of other genres as suggested by the genres name also fundamental to realtime tactics is realtime gameplay the genre has its roots in tactical and miniature wargaming but as computer implementation eventually allowed for ever more complex rule sets some games became less timeslicefocused and more continuous until eventually realtime play was achieved genre classification while some publications do refer to rtt as a distinct subgenre of realtime strategy or strategy comparison with realtime strategy in general terms military strategy refers to the use of a broad arsenal of weapons including diplomatic informational military and economic resources whereas military tactics is more concerned with shortterm goals such as winning an individual battle realtime strategy games have been criticized for an overabundance of tactical considerations when compared to the amount of strategic gameplay found in such games in an article for gamespy mark walker said that developers need to begin looking outside the genre for new ideas in order for strategy games to continue to be successful in the future in an article for gamasutra nathan toronto criticizes realtime strategy games for too often having only one valid means of victoryattritioncomparing them unfavorably to realtime tactics games according to toronto players awareness that their only way to win is militarily makes them unlikely to respond to gestures of diplomacy the result being that the winner of a realtime strategy game is too often the best tactician rather than the best strategist brief history and background further information chronology of realtime tactics video games wargaming with items or figurines representing soldiers or units for training or entertainment has been common for as long as organised conflicts though popular as tabletop games tactical wargames were relatively late in coming to computers largely due to game mechanics calling for large numbers of units and individual soldiers as well as advanced rules that would have required hardware capacities and interface designs beyond the capabilities of older hardware and software since most established rule sets were for turnbased tabletop games the conceptual leap to translate these categories to real time was also a problem that needed to be overcome avalon hills 1982 release legionaire for the atari 8bit was a realtime wargame of romans versus barbarians with game play reminiscent of the current realtime tactics template called by one review a realtime simulation of tactical combat likewise free fall associates 1983 title archon can be considered an early realtime tactics game built upon chess but including realtime battle sequences archon was highly influential and for instance silicon knights incs 1994 game dark legions was virtually identical to it adding only to archons concept that the player as in many tabletop wargames purchases his army before committing to battle drakkhen 1989 and its snes port 1991 were noteworthy for combining the genre with rpg and for introducing the genre to nintendo fans respectively drakkhen allowed the player to micromanage four specialized fantasy units in a 3d battlefield during each random encounter another predecessor was bits of magics centurion defender of rome published for the pc by electronic arts in 1990 in which similar to the recent rome total war game the game took place on a strategic map interspersed by battle sequences however though the battles were in realtime they were of small scope and player interaction was limited to deciding the initial troop disposition lords of the realm released in 1994 by impressions games introduced realtime control of these realtime

to facilitate the requirements of largescale realtime tactical games it was in 1995 that the regimentally focused wargame warhammer shadow of the horned rat was released groundbreaking not only in that it focused purely on the operational aspects of combat with all aspects pertaining regimental manoeuvring and formations support tactics terrain etc nor only in that it was entirely realtime but also that it introduced zoomable and rotatable 3d terrain in 1997 firaxis games released sid meiers gettysburg a detailed and faithful recreation of some of the most significant battles of the american civil war that introduced large scale tactical battlefield command using 3d released in 1996 by atomic games the close combat series is a simulation of squad and platoontype world war ii combat tactics which introduced a higher degree of operational realism than seen before combat mission went even further in this regard further as warhammer shadow of the horned rat was a translation of the warhammer fantasy battle tabletop system so was 1998s fasa studios mechcommander a translation of the battletech boardgame into a 2d computer game format in 1997 bungie released myth the fallen lords which introduced radically larger battlefields than ever before and included a realistic at the time physics engine in 2000 creative assembly created shogun total war taking map sizes to even greater levels as well as introducing historical and tactical realism until then unheard of in realtime computer games ground control was also released in 2000 gaining much attention for its luscious visuals but earning developers massive entertainment few sales in 2007 world in conflict was also released by massive entertainment eastern europe the 2000s decade saw a number of tactical simulations

by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed january 2009 learn how and when to remove this template message historical and contemporary realtime tactics games with historical or contemporary settings generally try to recreate the tactical environment of their selected period the most common eras and situations being the world war ii napoleonic warfare or ancient warfare numerically they make up the bulk of the genre while the degree of realism is uniform the scale of command and precise mechanics differ radically according to the period setting in keeping with the tactics of that period so for instance titles set in the napoleonic wars are often played at a company or battalion level with players controlling groups of sometimes hundreds of soldiers as a single unit whereas recreations of modern conflicts such as the iraq war tend to offer control down to squad or even individual level the total war series by the creative assembly as exemplified by the first title shogun total war 2000 is widely recognised for its largescale tactical recreations of battles units are organised and controlled in regiments frequently of fifty to a hundred soldiers and the games are built to encourage the use of authentic tactics battles are freeform and generally take place in open country and there are no plotted sidemissions as in the warhammer games discussed below rome total war 2004 was praised for its impressive attention to detail and encouragement of tactical thought sid meiers gettysburg 1997 and its sequel sid meiers antietam 1998 by firaxis games set in the american civil war are the bestknown examples of napoleonic style simulations directly after napoleon total war common to these games is the recreation in detail and scale of a particular set of significant or wellknown battles using the same engine firaxis and breakaway games also released waterloo napoleons last battle which recreates napoleon bonapartes last and most famous battle of 1815 also noteworthy is imperial glory 2005 by pyro studios which recreates the multipolar conflicts of europe between 1789 and 1830 the close combat series 1995 by atomic games are tactical battle simulations set in wwii known for a very high degree of realism taking into account limited ammunition severity of wounds and the psychology and mental welfare of individual soldiers talonsofts age of sail 1996 and age of sail ii 2001 are 3d naval realtime tactics games where you command sailing vessels in high sea and coastal battles beyond heading aspects such as amount of sails and cannon ordnance can be ordered sudden strike 2000 by fireglow games in contrast to the close combat series this title focuses on largerscale operations and mechanised tactics rather than lowlevel details though individual units have ammunition supplies and gain experience soldiers heroes of world war ii 2004 codemasters is similar to close combat also being set in wwii it offers greater autonomy over individual units as well as 3d graphics the full spectrum warrior series 2004 by pandemic studios is set in a fictional country similar to iraq the games revolve around a maximum of two fireteams of four soldiers each and offer engagements at a far more intimate level than the total war series or indeed the genre at large it also emphasises story more than most realtime tactics titles despite a visual appearance similar to firstperson shooters the player does not directly control any character instead only issuing orders to his troops as such it qualifies as a realtime tactical game and is distinct from the subgenre of firstperson shooters known as tactical shooters that incorporate some tactical aspects such as ubisofts rainbow six series and gearbox softwares brothers in arms cossacks 2 2005 is set during the napoleonic wars and supports battles of up to 64000 soldiers it has a high degree of realism with its morale system and damage model as well as the fact that the player controls companies of certain number of individual units morale serves as a role similar to hit points increasing or decreasing based upon certain events such as soldiers being fired at or soldiers firing upon the enemy the player is thus deprived of control over the company whenever it falls under a certain level of danger soldiers in the napoleonic wars carried muskets which did little damage over long distances and took a lot of time to reload this is reflected in the game as it takes a long time for a company to reload before it can produce another volley further reloading costs resources and the food resource is constantly drained depending on how many soldiers the player controls faces of war 2006 ubisoft is a sequel to soldiers heroes of

realtime tactics games belong to the warhammer fantasy battle series this loose series began with one of the earliest mainstream realtime tactics games warhammer shadow of the horned rat 1995 while the games depth of tactical simulation is comparable to that of total war it leans more toward skirmishes over epic battles and features both unique hero characters and a tightlyauthored story the highly influential video game myth the fallen lords 1997 emphasised formation cohesion to a lesser degree than the warhammer titles but introduced more extensive maps in 2006 warhammer mark of chaos was released similar in kind to the two preceding warhammer titles it however took gameplay away from the realistic focus and fidelity of the warhammer rules toward a more arcade and micromanagementoriented form kingdom under fire the crusaders and its sequel were complex and difficult games made in korea mixing both elements of rtt and dynasty warriorslike action recently

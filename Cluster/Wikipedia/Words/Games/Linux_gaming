playing and developing video games for the linux operating system involving a linux kernelbased operating system often used for all computing tasks like surfing the web office applications desktop publishing but also for gaming history see also open source video game history doom was one of the first major commercial games to be released for linux linux gaming started largely as an extension of the already present unix gaming scene with both systems sharing many similar titles these games were either mostly original or clones of arcade games and text adventures a notable example of this was the socalled bsd games a collection of interactive fiction titles the free software and open source methodologies which spawned the development of the operating system in general also spawned the creation of various early free games popular early titles included nethack netrek xbill xevil xbattle xconq and xpilot as the operating system itself grew and expanded the amount of free and opensource games also increased in scale and complexity early 1990s the beginning of linux as a gaming platform for commercial video games is widely credited to have begun in 1994 when dave d taylor ported the game doom to linux as well as many other systems during his spare time former loki software employee ryan c gordon late 1990s loki and growth on november 9 1998 a new software firm called loki software was founded by scott draeker a former lawyer who became interested in porting games to linux after being introduced to the system through his work as a software licensing attorney 2000s developers go it alone after lokis closure the linux game market experienced some changes although some new firms such as linux game publishing and runesoft would largely continue the role of a standard porting house the focus began to change with linux game proponents encouraging game developers to port their game products themselves or through individual contractors sales breakdown across systems of the first humble indie bundle by the number of purchasers top and dollar value of the payments bottom the linux gaming market also started to experience some growth towards the end of the decade with the rise of independent video game development with many indie developers favouring support for multiple platforms in 2009 the small indie game company entourev llc published voltley to linux which is the first commercial exclusive game for this operating system in the same year lgp released shadowgrounds which was the first commercial game for linux using the nvidia physx middleware 2010s steam gog and beyond in july 2012 game developer and content distributor valve software announced a port of their source engine for linux as well as stating their intention to release their steam digital distribution service for linux in november 2012 unity technologies ported their unity engine and game creation system to linux starting with version 4 all of the games created with the unity engine can now be ported to linux easily in september 2013 valve announced that they were releasing a gaming oriented linux based operating system called steamos with valve saying they had come to the conclusion that the environment best suited to delivering value to customers is an operating system built around steam itself in march 2014 gogcom announced they would begin to support linux titles on their drm free store starting the same year after previously stating they would not be able due to too many distributions in march and april 2014 two major developers epic games and crytek announced linux support for their next generation engines unreal engine 4 and cryengine respectively on 22 august 2018 valve released their fork of wine called proton aimed at gaming it features some improvements over the vanilla wine such as vulkanbased directx 11 and 12 implementations steam integration better full screen and game controller support and improved performance for multithreaded games market share vs installed base see also linux adoption desktop linux adoption market share can be estimated based on sales numbers eg during q2 2013 793 of smartphones sold worldwide were running android when discussing free and opensource software the term installed base seems rather popular it is installation not embedment or preinstallation that tailors a product to the owners personal needs unfortunately installed base as opposed to market share proves to be a tricky thing to gauge surveys conducted by software such as ubuntu software center or steam can only tell about the installed base of a particular program or version or hardware only on the machines on which the digital distribution software is already installed in 2010 in the first humble bundle sales linux accounted for 18 the steam client tracks usage and reported in march 2014 that less than 12 of users are using some form of linux as their platforms primary operating system supported hardware linux as a gaming platform can also refer to operating systems based on the linux kernel and specifically designed for the sole purpose of gaming examples are steamos which is an operating system for steam machines and computers video game consoles built from components found in the classical home computer embedded operating systems like tizen and pandora and handheld game consoles like gp2x and neo geo x the nvidia shield runs android as an operating system which is based on a modified linux kernel the open source design of the linux software platform allows the operating system to be compatible with various computer instruction sets and many peripherals such as game controllers and headmounted displays as an example htc vive which is a virtual reality headmounted display supports the linux gaming platform performance in 2013 tests by phoronix showed realworld performance of games on linux with proprietary nvidia and amd drivers were mostly comparable to results on windows 81 software architecture an operating system based on the linux kernel and customized specifically for gaming could adopt the vanilla linux kernel with only little changes orlike the android operating systembe based on a relative extensively modified linux kernel it could adopt gnu c library or bionic or something like it the entire middleware or parts of it could very well be closedsource and proprietary software the same is true for the video games there are free and opensource video games available for the linux operating system as well as proprietary ones linux kernel the subsystems already mainlined and available in the linux kernel are most probably performant enough so to not impede the gaming experience in any way similar to the way the linux kernel can be for example adapted to run better on supercomputers there are adaptations targeted at improving the performance of games a project concerning itself with this issue is called liquorix available software for video game designers debuggers several game development tools have been available for linux including gnu debugger lldb valgrind glslang and others vogl a debugger for opengl was released on 12 march 2014 see also game editor apitrace and gtkradiant amd codexl an opensource crossplatform clone of enterbrains rpg maker 2000 2003 xp vx called openrpg maker is currently in development available interfaces and sdks there are a couple of interfaces and software development kits available for linux almost all of them are crossplatform most are free and opensource software subject to the terms of the zlib license making it possible to static link against them from fully closedsource proprietary software one difficulty due to this abundance of interfaces is the difficulty for programmers to choose the best suitable audio api for their purpose the main developer of the pulseaudio project lennart poettering commented on this issue physics engines audio libraries that are available as modules for game engines have been available for linux for a long time the book programming linux games covers a couple of the available apis suited for video game development for linux while the linux programming

can be simply described as middleware a multitude of companies exist worldwide whose main or only product is software that is meant to be licensed and integrated into a game engine their primary target is the video game industry but the film industry also utilizes such software for special effects some very few well known examples are classical physics havok newton game dynamics and physx audio audiokinetic wwise fmod other speedtree a significant share of the available middleware already runs natively on linux only a very few run exclusively on linux available ides and source code editors numerous source code editors and ides are available for linux among which are visual studio code sublime text codeblocks qt creator emacs or vim multimonitor a multimonitor setup is supported on linux at least by amd eyefinity amd catalyst xinerama and randr on both x11 and wayland serious sam 3 bfe is one example of a game that runs natively on linux and supports very high resolutions and is validated by amd to support their eyefinity voice over ip the specifications of the mumble protocol are freely available and there are bsdlicensed implementations for both servers and clients the positional audio api of mumble is supported by eg cube 2 sauerbraten wine wine software wine is a compatibility layer that provides binary compatibility and makes it possible to run software that was written and compiled for microsoft windows on linux the wine project hosts a usersubmitted application database known as wine appdb that lists programs and games along with ratings and reviews which detail how well they run with wine wine appdb also has a commenting system which often includes instructions on how to modify a system to run a certain game which cannot run on a normal or default configuration many games are rated as running flawlessly and there are also many other games that can be run with varying degrees of success the use of wine for gaming has proved controversial in the linux community as some feel it is preventing or at least hindering the further growth of native gaming on the platform emulators there are numerous emulators for linux there are also apis virtual machines and machine emulators that provide binary compatibility basilisk ii for the 68040 macintosh dosbox and dosemu for msdospc dos and compatibles dolphin for the nintendo gamecube wii and the

developers alike the developmentkit is built around it game editors use it to build levels tools such as blender or 3ds max are employed to create the geometry of object andor animations of those game data has reached enormous amounts while game engines are sometimes released under some free software license instead or additionally to licensing them the game data is usually not see also list of game engines and list of game engine recreations the game engine is the software solely responsible for the game mechanics or rules defining game play there are different game engines for firstperson shooters strategy video games etc besides the game mechanics software is also needed to handle graphics audio physics input handling and networking game engines that are used by many video games and run on top of linux include c4 engine terathon software cryengine crytek diesel 20 grin hpl engine 13 frictional games id tech 14 id software serious engine croteam source valve corporation unigine

runesoft ported airline tycoon deluxe to raspberry pi was running debian gnulinux source ports source port micropolis an open source port of simcity several developers have released the source code to many of their legacy titles allowing them to be run as native applications on many alternative platforms including linux examples of games which were ported to linux this way include duke nukem 3d shadow warrior rise of the triad kens labyrinth seven kingdoms warzone 2100 homeworld call to power ii wolfenstein 3d heretic hexen hexen ii aliens versus predator descent descent ii and freespace 2 several game titles that were previously released for linux were also able to be expanded or updated because of the availability of game code including doom abuse quake quake ii quake iii arena and jagged alliance 2 some derivatives based on released source code have also been released for linux such as aleph one and micropolis for marathon 2 durandal and simcity respectively certain game titles were even able to be ported due to availability of shared engine code even though the games code itself remains proprietary or otherwise unavailable such as the video game strife or the multiplayer component of star trek voyager elite force some games have even been ported entirely or partially by reverse engineering and game engine recreation such as warcraft ii through wargus or commander keen another trick is to attempt hacking the game to work as a mod on another native title such as with the original unreal additionally some games can be run through the use of linux specific runtime environments such as the case of certain games made with adventure game studio such as the chzo mythos or certain titles made with the rpg maker tool games derived from released code with both free

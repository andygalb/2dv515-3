husband leonard bosack who was in charge of the stanford university computer science departments computers despite founding cisco in 1984 bosack along with kirk lougheed continued to work at stanford on ciscos first product it consisted of exact replicas of stanfords blue box router and a stolen copy of the universitys multipleprotocol router software the software was originally written some years earlier at stanford medical school by research engineer william yeager bosack and lougheed adapted it into what became the foundation for cisco ios on july 11 1986 bosack and lougheed were forced to resign from stanford and the university contemplated filing criminal complaints against cisco and its founders for the theft of its software hardware designs and other intellectual properties in 1987 stanford licensed the router software and two computer boards to cisco in addition to bosack lerner and lougheed greg satz a programmer and richard troiano who handled sales completed the early cisco team the companys first ceo was bill graves who held the position from 1987 to 1988 in 1988 john morgridge was appointed ceo the name cisco was derived from the city name san francisco which is why

early cisco devices coupled with flexibility of operating system ios allowed for keeping up with evolving technology needs by means of frequent software upgrades some popular models of that time such as cisco 2500 managed to stay in production for almost a decade virtually unchangeda rarity in hightech industry although cisco was strongly rooted in the enterprise environment the company was quick to capture the emerging service provider environment entering the sp market with new highcapacity product lines such as cisco 7000 and cisco 8500 between 1992 and 1994 cisco acquired several companies in ethernet switching such as kalpana grand junction and most notably mario mazzolas crescendo communications which together formed the catalyst business unit at the time the company envisioned layer 3 routing and layer 2 ethernet token ring switching as complementary functions of different intelligence and architecturethe former was slow and complex the latter was fast but simple this philosophy dominated the companys product lines throughout the 1990s in 1995 john morgridge was succeeded by john chambers 19962005 internet and silicon intelligence john t chambers led cisco as its ceo between 1995 and 2015 pictured at 2010 world economic forum in davos switzerland the phenomenal growth of the internet in midtolate 1990s quickly changed the telecom landscape as the internet protocol ip became widely adopted the importance of multiprotocol routing declined nevertheless cisco managed to catch the internet wave with products ranging from modem access shelves as5200 to core gsr routers that quickly became vital to internet service providers and by 1998 gave cisco de facto monopoly in this critical segment in late march 2000 at the height of the dotcom bubble cisco became the most valuable company in the world with a market capitalization of more than 500billion the perceived complexity of programming routing functions in silicon led to formation of several startups determined to find new ways to process ip and mpls packets entirely in hardware and blur boundaries between routing and switching one of them juniper networks shipped their first product in 1999 and by 2000

designed to support the lowend linksys products and future consumer products such as flip video camera acquired by cisco in 2009 on the more traditional business side cisco continued to develop its extensive enterprisefocused routing switching and security portfolio the quickly growing importance of ethernet also influenced the companys product lines prompting the company to morph the successful catalyst 6500 ethernet switch into allpurpose cisco 7600 routing platform however limits of ios and aging crescendo architecture also forced cisco to look at merchant silicon in the carrier ethernet segment this resulted in a new asr9000 product family intended to consolidate companys carrier ethernet and subscriber management business around ezchipbased hardware and iosxr cisco also expanded into new markets by acquisitionone example being a 2009 purchase of mobile specialist starent networks that resulted in asr5000 product line throughout the mid2000s cisco also built a significant

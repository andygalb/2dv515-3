game design for video game design see video game design game design is the art of applying design and aesthetics to create a game for entertainment or for educational exercise or experimental purposes increasingly elements and principles of game design are also applied to other interactions particularly virtual ones see gamification game design creates goals rules and challenges to define a board game card game dice game casino game roleplaying game sport video game war game or simulation that produces desirable interactions among its participants and possibly spectators academically game design is part of game studies while game theory studies strategic decision making primarily in nongame situations games have historically inspired seminal research in the fields of probability artificial intelligence economics and optimization theory applying game design to itself is a current research topic in metadesign history this section does not cite any sources please help improve

gambling and board games are known respectively to have existed for at least nine thousand folk process tabletop games played today whose descent can be traced from ancient times include chess go pachisi backgammon mahjong mancala and pickup sticks the rules of these games were not codified until early modern times and their features gradually evolved and changed over time through the folk process given this these games are not considered to have had a designer or been the result of a design process in the modern sense after the rise of commercial game publishing in the late 19th century many games which had formerly evolved via folk processes became commercial properties often with custom scoring pads or preprepared material for example the similar public domain games generala yacht and yatzy led to the commercial game yahtzee in the mid1950s today many commercial games such as taboo balderdash pictionary or times up are descended from traditional parlour games adapting traditional games to become commercial properties is an example of game design similarly many sports such as soccer and baseball are the result of folk processes while others were designed such as basketball invented in 1891 by james naismith new media technological advances have provided new media for games throughout history the printing press allowed packs of playing cards adapted from mahjong tiles to be massproduced leading to many new card games accurate topographic maps produced as lithographs and provided free to prussian officers helped popularize wargaming cheap bookbinding printed labels wrapped around cardboard led to massproduced board games with custom boards inexpensive hollow lead figurine casting contributed to the development of miniature wargaming cheap custom dice led to poker dice flying discs led to disc golf and ultimate personal computers contributed to the popularity of computer games leading to the wide availability of video game consoles and video games smart phones have led to a proliferation of mobile games the first games in a new medium are frequently adaptations of older games pong one of the first widely disseminated video games adapted table tennis later games will often exploit distinctive properties of a new medium adapting older games and creating original games for new media are both examples of game design theory game studies this section may stray from the topic of the article please help improve this section or discuss this issue on the talk page may 2017 game studies or gaming theory is a discipline that deals with the critical study of games game design players and their role in society and culture prior to the latetwentieth century the academic study of games was rare and limited to fields such as history and anthropology as the video game revolution took off in the early 1980s so did academic interest in games resulting in a field that draws on diverse methodologies and schools of thought these influences may be characterized broadly in three ways the social science approach the humanities approach and the industry and engineering approach broadly speaking the social scientific approach has concerned itself with the question of what do games do to people using tools and methods such as surveys controlled laboratory experiments and ethnography researchers have investigated both the positive and negative impacts that playing games could have on people more sociologically informed research has sought to move away from simplistic ideas of gaming as either negative or positive but rather seeking to understand its role and location in the complexities of everyday life in general terms the humanities approach has concerned itself with the question of what meanings are made through games using tools and methods such as interviews ethnographies and participant observation researchers have investigated the various roles that videogames play in peoples lives and activities together with the meaning they assign to their experiences from an industry perspective a lot of game studies research can be seen as the academic response to the videogame industrys questions regarding the products it creates and sells the main question this approach deals with can be summarized as how can we create better games with the accompanying what makes a game good good can be taken to mean many different things including providing an entertaining and an engaging experience being easy to learn and play and being innovative and having novel experiences different approaches to studying this problem have included looking at describing how to design games strategic decision making game theory game theory is a study of strategic decision making specifically it is the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decisionmakers the subject first addressed zerosum games such that one persons gains exactly equal net losses of the other participant or participants today however game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations and has developed into an umbrella term for the logical side of decision science the games studied in game theory are welldefined mathematical objects to be fully defined a game must specify the following elements the players of the game the information and actions available to each player at each decision point and the payoffs for each outcome rasmusen refers to these four essential elements by the acronym papi a game theorist typically uses these elements along with a solution concept of their choosing to deduce a set of equilibrium strategies for each player such that when these strategies are employed no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy these equilibrium strategies determine an equilibrium to the gamea stable state in which either one outcome occurs or a set of outcomes occur with known probability design elements games can be characterized by what the player does and what the player experiences this is often referred to as gameplay major key elements identified in this context are tools and rules that define the overall context of game tools of play games are often classified by the components required to play them eg miniatures a ball cards a board and pieces or a computer in places where the use of leather is well established the ball has been a popular game piece throughout recorded history resulting in a worldwide popularity of ball games such as rugby basketball football cricket tennis and volleyball other tools are more idiosyncratic to a certain region many countries in europe for instance have unique standard decks of playing cards other games such as chess may be traced primarily through the development and evolution of its game pieces many game tools are tokens meant to represent other things a token may be a pawn on a board play money or an intangible item such as a point scored games such as hideandseek or tag do not utilise any obvious tool rather their interactivity is defined by the environment games with the same or similar rules may have different gameplay if the environment is altered for example hideandseek in a school building differs from the same game in a park an auto race can be radically different depending on the track or street course even with the same cars rule development see also game mechanics gameplay and balance game design whereas games are often characterized by their tools they are often defined by their rules while rules are subject to variations and changes enough change in the rules usually results in a new game there are exceptions to this in that some games deliberately involve the changing of their own rules but even then there are often immutable metarules rules generally determine turn order the rights and responsibilities of the players each players goals and how game components interact with each other in to produce changes in a games state player rights may include when they may spend resources or move tokens victory conditions common win conditions are being first to amass a certain quota of points or tokens as in settlers of catan having the greatest number of tokens at the end of the game as in monopoly some relationship of ones game tokens to those of ones opponent as in chesss checkmate or reaching a certain point in a storyline as in most roleplaygames single or multiplayer most games require multiple players singleplayer games are unique in respect to the type of challenges a player faces unlike a game with multiple players competing with or against each other to reach the games goal a singleplayer game is against an element of the environment against ones own skills against time or against chance this is also true of cooperative games in which multiple players share a common goal and win or lose together many games described as singleplayer or cooperative could alternatively be described as puzzles or recreations in that they do not involve strategic behavior as defined by game theory in which the expected reaction of an opponent to a possible move becomes a factor in choosing which move to make games against opponents simulated with artificial intelligence differ from other singleplayer games in that the algorithms used usually do incorporate strategic behavior storyline and plot stories told in games may focus on narrative elements that can be communicated through the use of mechanics and player choice narrative plots in games generally have a clearly defined and simplistic structure mechanical choices on the part of the designers often drastically effect narrative elements in the game however due to a lack of unified and standardized teaching and understanding of narrative elements in games individual interpretations methods and terminology vary wildly because of this most narrative elements in games are created unconsciously and intuitively however as a general rule game narratives increase in complexity and scale as player choice or game mechanics increase in complexity and scale one example of this is removing a players ability to directly affect the plot for a limited time this lack of player choice necessitates an increase in mechanical complexity and could be used as a metaphor to symbolize depression that is felt by a character in the narrative luck and strategy a games tools and rules will result in its requiring skill strategy luck or a combination thereof and are classified accordingly games of skill include games of physical skill such as wrestling tug of war hopscotch target shooting and horseshoes and games of mental skill such as checkers and chess games of strategy include checkers chess go arimaa and tictactoe and often require special equipment to play them games of chance include gambling games blackjack mahjongg roulette etc as well as snakes and ladders and rock paper scissors most require equipment such as cards or dice most games contain two or all three of these elements for example american football and baseball involve both physical skill and strategy while tiddlywinks poker and monopoly combine strategy and chance many card and board games combine all three most tricktaking games involve mental skill strategy and an element of chance as do many strategic board games such as risk settlers of catan and carcassonne use as educational tool further information learning through play by learning through play key ways that young children learn include playing being with other people being active exploring and new experiences talking to themselves communication with others meeting physical and mental challenges being shown how to do new things practicing and repeating skills and having fun play develops childrens content knowledge and provides children the opportunity to develop social skills competences and disposition to learn development process game design is part of a games development from concept to its final form typically the development process is an iterative process with repeated phases of testing and revision during revision additional design or redesign may be needed development team game designer a game designer or inventor is the person who invents a games concept its central mechanisms and its rules often the game designer also invents the games title and if the game isnt abstract its theme sometimes these activities are done by the game publisher not the designer or may be dictated by a licensed property such as when designing a game based on a film game developer a game developer is the person who fleshes out the details of a games design oversees its testing and revises the game in response to player feedback often the game designer is also its developer although some publishers do extensive development of games to suit their particular target audience after licensing a game from a designer for larger games such as collectible card games and most video games a team is used and the designer and developer roles are usually split among multiple people game artist game artist a game artist is an artist who creates art for one or more types of games many graphic elements of games are created by the designer when producing a prototype of the game revised by the developer based on testing and then further refined by the artist and combined with artwork as a game is prepared for publication or release for video games game artists are responsible for all of the aspects of game development that call for visual art concept a game concept is an idea for a game briefly describing its core play mechanisms who the players represent and how they win or lose a game concept may be pitched to a game publisher in a similar manner as film ideas are pitched to potential film producers alternatively game publishers holding a game license to intellectual property in other media may solicit game concepts from several designers before picking one to design a game typically paying the designer in advance against future royalties design during design a game concept is fleshed out mechanisms are specified in terms of components boards cards onscreen entities etc and rules the play sequence and possible player actions are defined as well as how the game starts ends and what is its winning condition in video games storyboards and screen mockups may be created prototype a game prototype is a draft version of a game used for testing typically creating a prototype marks the shift from game design to game development and testing although prototyping in regards to humancomputer interaction and interaction design are both studied the use of prototyping in game design has remained relatively unexplored its known that game design has clear benefits from prototyping such as exploring new game design possibilities and technologies the field of game design has different characteristics than other types of software industries that considers prototyping in game design in a different category and need a new perspective testing game testing is a major part of game development during testing players play the game and provide feedback on its gameplay the usability of its components or screen elements the clarity of its goals and rules ease of learning and enjoyment to the game developer the developer then revises the design its components presentation and rules before testing it again later testing may take place with focus groups to test consumer reactions before publication during testing various balance issues may be identified requiring changes to the games design video game testing is a software testing process for quality control of video games issues different types of games pose different game design issues board games charles darrows 1935 patent for monopoly includes specific design elements developed during the prototype phase prototypes are very common in the later stages of board game design and prototype circles in many cities today provide an opportunity for designers to play and critique each others games board game design is the development of rules and presentational aspects of a board game when a player takes part in a game it is the players selfsubjection to the rules that creates a sense of purpose for the duration of the game beyond this board game design reflects the culture in which the board game is produced the most ancient board games known today are over 5000 years old they are frequently abstract in character and their design is primarily focused on a core set of simple rules of those that are still played today games like go c400bc mancala c700ad and chess c600ad have gone through many presentational andor rule variations in the case of chess for example new variants are developed constantly to focus on certain aspects of the game or just for variations sake traditional board games date from the nineteenth and early twentieth century whereas ancient board game design was primarily focused on rules alone traditional board games were often influenced by victorian mores academic eg history and geography and moral didacticism were important design features for traditional games and puritan associations between dice and the devil meant that early american game designers eschewed their use in board games entirely recent developments in modern board game design can be traced to the 1980s in germany and have led to increased popularity of germanstyle board games also known as eurogames or designer games the design emphasis of these board games is to give players meaningful choices modern technological advances have had a democratizing effect on board game production with services like kickstarter providing designers with essential startup capital and tools like 3d printers facilitating the production of game pieces and board game prototypes a modern adaptation of figure games are miniature wargames like warhammer 40000 card games card games include games with cards that are customtailored to the game as in many modern games as well as those whose design is constricted by the type of the deck of cards like tarot or the foursuited latin decks card games can be played for fun such as go fish or as gambling games such as poker in asian cultures special sets of tiles can serve the same function as cards as in mahjong a game similar to and thought to be the distant ancestor of the western card game rummy western dominoes games are believed to have developed from asian tile games in the 18th century magic the gathering was the first collectible card game or trading card game in 1993 the line between card and board games is not clearcut as many card games such as solitaire involve playing cards to form a tableau a spatial layout or board many board games in turn uses specialized cards to provide random events such as the chance cards of monopoly game or as the central mechanism driving play as in many carddriven wargames as cards are typically shuffled and revealed gradually during play most card games involve randomness either initially or during play and hidden information such as the cards in a players hand this is in contrast to many board games in which most of the games current state is visible to all participants even though players may also have a small amount of private information such as the letter tiles on each players rack during scrabble how players play their cards revealing information and interacting with previous plays as they do so is central to card game design in partnership card games such as bridge rules limiting communication between players on the same team become an important part of the game design this idea of limited communication has been extended to cooperative card games such as hanabi dice games a set of poker dice and a dice cup dice games are among the oldest known games and have often been associated with gambling nongambling dice games such as yatzy poker dice or yahtzee became popular in the mid20th century the line between dice and board games is not clearcut as dice are often used as randomization devices in board games such as monopoly or risk while serving as the central drivers of play in games such as backgammon or pachisi dice games differ from card games in that each throw of the dice is an independent event whereas the odds of a given card being drawn is affected by all the previous cards drawn or revealed from a deck dice game design often centers around forming scoring combinations and managing rerolls either by limiting their number as in yahtzee or by introducing a pressyourluck element as in cant stop casino games see also house edge all casino games are designed to mathematically favor the house the house edge for a slot machine can range widely between 2 and 15 percent casino game design can entail the creation of an entirely new casino game the creation of a variation on an existing casino game or the creation of a new side bet on an existing casino game casino game mathematician michael shackleford has noted that it is much more common for casino game designers today to make successful variations than entirely new casino games unlike the majority of other games which are designed primarily in the interest of the player one of the central aims of casino game design is to optimize the house advantage and maximize revenue from gamblers successful casino game design works to provide entertainment for the player and revenue for the gambling house to maximise player entertainment casino games are designed with simple easytolearn rules that emphasize winning ie whose rules enumerate many victory conditions and few loss conditions to maximise success for the gambling house casino games are designed to be easy for croupiers to operate and for pit managers to oversee the two most fundamental rules of casino game design is that the games must

players likewise the progression of a roleplaying game is determined in large part by the gamemaster whose individual campaign design may be directed by one of several roleplaying game theories there is no central core for tabletop roleplaying game theory because different people want such different things out of the games probably the most famous category of rpg theory gns theory assumes that people want one of three things out of the game a better more interestingly challenging game to create a more interesting story or a better simulation in other words better rules to support worldbuilding gns theory has been abandoned by its creator partly because it neglects emotional investment and partly because it just didnt work properly there are techniques that people use such as dice pools to better create the game they want but with no consistent goal or agreement for what makes for a good game theres no overarching theory generally agreed on sports this section needs

display device nixie tubes led display and vf display top to bottom a display device is an output device for presentation of information in visual when the input information that is supplied has an electrical signal the display is called an electronic display common applications for electronic visual displays are televisions or computer monitors history history of display technology in the history of display technology a variety of display devices and technologies have been used design there are various designs for display devices using various technologies several components are common to most display devices components display or screen the portion of the device that displays changeable image bezel the area surrounding portion that displays changing information housing the enclosure of the display types of electronic displays electronic visual display in use these are the technologies used to create the various displays in use today electroluminescent el display liquid

digits or alphanumeric characters they are called segment displays because they are composed of several segments that switch on and off to give appearance of desired glyph the segments are usually single leds or liquid crystals they are mostly used in digital watches and pocket calculators there are several types the common segment displays shown side by side 7segment 9segment 14segment and

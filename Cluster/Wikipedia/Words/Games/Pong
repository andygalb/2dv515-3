atari inc atari engineer allan alcorn designed and built pong as a training exercise pong was the first game developed by atari alcorn first examined bushnells schematics for computer space but found them to be illegible he went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of transistortransistor logic and bushnells game feeling the basic game was too boring alcorn added features to give the game more appeal he divided the paddle into eight segments to change the balls angle of return for example the center segments return the ball a 90 angle in relation to the paddle while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles he also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play missing the ball reset the speed three months into development bushnell told alcorn he wanted the game to feature realistic sound effects and a roaring crowd the pong prototype that was used in the tavern in august 1972 bushnell and alcorn installed the pong prototype at a local bar andy capps tavern after hearing about the games success bushnell decided there would be more profit for atari to manufacture the game rather than license it but the interest of bally and midway had already been piqued home version ataris home pong console released through sears in 1975 after the success of pong bushnell pushed his employees to create new products bushnell and gene lipkin ataris vicepresident of sales approached toy and electronic retailers to sell home pong but were rejected retailers felt the product was too expensive and would not interest consumers while at the show they met quinn again and a few days later set up a meeting with him to obtain a sales order in order to gain approval from the sporting goods department quinn suggested atari demonstrate the game to executives in chicago alcorn and lipkin traveled to the sears tower and despite a technical complication in connection with an antenna on top of the building which broadcast on the same channel as the game obtained approval bushnell told quinn he could produce 75000units in time for the christmas season however quinn requested double the amount though bushnell knew atari lacked the capacity to manufacture 150000units he agreed the magnavox odyssey invented by ralph h baer inspired pongs development lawsuit from magnavox the success of pong attracted the attention of ralph baer the inventor of the magnavox odyssey and his employer sanders associates sanders had an agreement with magnavox to handle the odysseys sublicensing which included dealing with infringement on its exclusive rights however magnavox had not pursued legal action against atari and numerous other companies that released pong clones after considering his options bushnell decided to settle with magnavox out of court bushnells lawyer felt they could win however he estimated legal costs of us15 million which would have exceeded ataris funds magnavox offered atari an agreement to become a licensee for us700000 other companies producing pong clonesataris competitorswould have to pay royalties in addition magnavox would obtain the rights to atari products developed over the next year impact and legacy dedicated pong consoles

the game that launched the video game industry as a lucrative enterprise bushnell felt that pong was especially significant in its role as a social lubricant since it was multiplayeronly and did not require each player to use more than one hand it was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say id like to play pong and theres nobody to play it was a way you could play games you were sitting shoulder to shoulder you could talk you could laugh you could challenge each other as you became better friends you could put down your beer and hug you could put your arm around the person you could play lefthanded if you so desired in fact there are a lot of people who have come up to me over the years and said i met my wife playing pong and thats kind of a nice thing to have achieved sequels and remakes bushnell felt the best way to compete against imitators was to create better products leading atari to produce sequels in the years followings the

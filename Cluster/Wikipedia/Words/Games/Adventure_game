an interactive story driven by exploration and puzzlesolving colossal cave adventure is identified as the first such adventure game first released in 1976 while other notable adventure game series include zork kings quest the secret of monkey island and myst initial adventure games developed in the 1970s and early 1980s were textbased using text parsers to translate the players input into commands as personal computers became more powerful with the ability to show graphics the graphic adventure game format became popular initially by augmenting players text commands with graphics but soon moving towards point and click interfaces further computer advancements led to adventure games with more immersive graphics using realtime or prerendered threedimensional scenes or fullmotion video taken from the first or thirdperson perspective for markets in the western hemisphere the genres popularity peaked during the late 1980s to mid1990s when many considered it to be among the most technically advanced genres but had become a niche genre in the early 2000s due to the popularity of firstperson shooters and became difficult to find publishers to support such ventures since then a resurgence in the genre has occurred spurred on by success of independent video game development particularly from crowdfunding efforts the wide availability of digital distribution enabling episodic approaches and the proliferation of new gaming platforms including portable consoles and mobile devices the walking dead is considered to be a key title that rejuvenated the genre within the asian markets adventure games continue to be popular in the form of visual novels which make up nearly 70 of pc games released in japan the asian markets have also found markets for adventure games for portable and mobile gaming devices japanese adventure games tend to be distinct from western adventure games and have their own separate development history definition components of an adventure game citations puzzle solving or problem solving narrative or interactive story exploration player assumes the role of a characterhero collection or manipulation of objects the term adventure game originated from the 1970s text computer game colossal cave adventure often referred to simply as adventure essential elements of the genre include storytelling exploration and puzzle solving relationship to other genres combat and action challenges are limited or absent in adventure games adventure games are also distinct from roleplaying video games that involve action teambuilding and points management game design puzzlesolving adventure games contain a variety of puzzles decoding messages finding and using items opening locked doors or finding and exploring new locations some puzzles are criticized for the obscurity of their solutions for example the combination of a clothes line clamp and deflated rubber duck used to gather a key stuck between the subway tracks in the longest journey which exists outside of the games narrative and serves only as an obstacle to the player gathering and using items many adventure games make use of an inventory management screen as a distinct gameplay mode many puzzles in these games involve gathering and using items from their inventory story setting and themes adventure games are singleplayer experiences that are largely storydriven since adventure games are driven by storytelling character development usually follows literary conventions of personal and emotional growth rather than new powers or abilities that affect gameplay dialogue and conversation trees further information dialog tree adventure games have strong storylines with significant dialog and sometimes make effective use of recorded dialog or narration from voice actors goals success and failure the primary goal in adventure games is the completion of the assigned quest the primary failure condition in adventure games inherited from more actionoriented games is player death without the clearly identified enemies of other genres its inclusion in adventure games is controversial and many developers now either avoid it or take extra steps to foreshadow death subgenres text adventures and interactive fiction interactive fiction a computer terminal running zork 1977 one of the first commercially successful text adventure games text adventures convey the games story through passages of text revealed to the player in response to typed instructions graphic adventure graphic adventures are adventure games that use graphics to convey the environment to the player pointandclick adventure games the whispered world 2009 is an example of a contextbased pointandclick adventure game using highdefinition graphics and animation pointandclick adventure games are those where the player typically controls their character through a pointandclick interface using a computer mouse or similar pointing device though additional control schemes may also be available the player clicks to move their character around interact with nonplayer characters often initiating conversation trees with them examine objects in the games settings or with their characters item inventory many pointandclick games would include a list of onscreen verbs to describe specific actions in the manner of a text adventure but newer games have used more contextsensitive user interface elements to reduce or eliminate this approach often these games come down to collecting items for the characters inventory and figuring where is the right time to use that item the player would need to use clues from the visual elements of the game descriptions of the various items and dialogue from other characters to figure this out later games developed by sierra online including the kings quest games and nearly all of the lucasarts adventure games are pointandclick based games escape the room games escape the room escape the room games are a further specialization of pointandclick adventure games these games are typically short and confined to a small space to explore with almost no interaction with nonplayer characters most games of this type require the player to figure out how to escape a room using the limited resources within it and through the solving of logic puzzles other variants include games that require the player to manipulate a complex object to achieve a certain end in the fashion of a puzzle box these games are often delivered in adobe flash format and are also popular on mobile devices examples of the subgenre include the submachineseries mystery of time and space motas and the room puzzle adventure games puzzle adventure games are adventure games that put a strong emphasis on logic puzzles they typically emphasize selfcontained puzzle challenges with logic puzzle toys or games completing each puzzle opens more of the games world to explore additional puzzles to solve and can expand on the games story but since then puzzle adventure games have taken advantage of modern game engines to present the games in full 3d settings such as the talos principle myst itself has been recreated in such a fashion in the title realmyst other puzzle adventure games are casual adventure games made up series of puzzles used to explore and progress the story exemplified by the witness and the professor layton series of games narrative games narrative adventure games are those that generally favor narrative storytelling over gameplay with gameplay present to help immerse the player into the games story though narrative games are similar to interactive movies and visual novels in that they present prescripted scenes the advancement of computing power can render prescripted scenes in realtime thus providing for more depth of gameplay that is reactive to the player gameplay in narrative games may include working through conversation trees solving puzzles or more recently the use of quick time events to aid in action sequences to keep the player involved in the story frequently these games allow for branching narratives with choices made by the player influencing events throughout the game while these choices do not usually alter the overall direction and major plot elements of the games story they help personalize the story to the players desire through the ability to choose these determinants most telltale games titles such as the walking dead are narrative games other examples include sega am2s shenmue series konamis shadow of memories quantic dreams fahrenheit heavy rain and beyond two souls dontnod entertainments life is strange series and night in the woods walking simulators the stanley parable 2013 is a firstperson walking simulator set in an office building walking simulators are narrative games that generally eschew any type of gameplay outside of movement and environmental interaction that allow players to experience their story through exploration and discovery the term walking simulator has sometimes been used pejoratively but since has been come to be an accepted manner to call such games visual novel visual novel a common layout for a visual novel game a visual novel bijuaru noberu is a hybrid of text and graphical adventure games typically featuring textbased story and interactivity aided by static or spritebased visuals they resemble mixedmedia novels or tableau vivant stage plays most visual novels typically feature dialog trees branching storylines and multiple endings a common type of visual novel are dating sims which has the player attempt to improve a relationship with one or more other characters such as hatoful boyfriend interactive movie interactive movie some adventure games have been presented as interactive movies these are games where most of the graphics are either fully prerendered or use full motion video from live actors on a set stored on a media that allows fast random access such as laserdisc or cdrom the arcade versions of dragons lair and space ace are canonical examples of such works the games software would present a scene and players would have to input the correct moves with a joystick and button to continue on the choices leading to the game playing a new scene from the media the video may be augmented by additional computer graphics under a killing moon used a combination of full motion video and 3d graphics because these games are limited by what has been prerendered or recorded there is a lack of player interactivity in these titles with wrong choices or decisions leading quickly to an ending scene hybrids there are a number of hybrid graphical adventure games borrowing from two or more of the above classifications for example the ace attorney series of games while presenting itself as a visual novel includes elements of pointandclick adventure games the zero escape series wraps several escapetheroom puzzles within the context of a visual novel actionadventure game while most adventure games typically do not include any timebased interactivity by the player actionadventure games are a hybrid of action games with adventure games that often require to the player to react quickly to events as they occur on screen while the first the legend of zelda brought the actionadventure concept to a broader audience history of western adventure games text adventures 19761989 telechrometype output of will crowthers original version of colossal cave adventure the origins of text adventure games is difficult to trace as records of computing around the 1970s were not as well documented textbased games had existed prior to 1976 that featured elements of exploring maps or solving puzzles such as hunt the wumpus 1975 but lacked a narrative element a feature essential for adventure games colossal cave adventure set concepts and gameplay approaches that would become staples of text adventures and interactive fiction the genre gained commercial success with titles designed for home computers scott adams launched adventure international to publish text adventures including an adaptation of colossal cave adventure while a number of mit students formed infocom to bring their game zork from mainframe to home computers and was a commercial success other companies in this field included level 9 computing magnetic scrolls and melbourne house when personal computers gained the ability to display graphics the text adventure genre began to wane and by 1990 there were few if any commercial releases noncommercial text adventure games are still developed today as the genre of interactive fiction graphical development 19801990 mystery house for the apple ii was the first adventure game to use graphics in the early home computer era the first known graphical adventure game was mystery house 1980 by sierra online then at the time known as online systems other examples of early games include koeis night life and danchi tsuma no yuwaku 1982 sherwood forest 1982 yuji horiis portopia serial murder case 1983 the return of heracles which faithfully portrayed greek mythology by stuart smith 1983 dale johnsons masquerade 1983 antonio antiochias transylvania 1982 rereleased in 1984 and adventure construction set 1985 one of the early hits of electronic arts as computers gained the ability to use pointing devices and pointandclick interfaces graphical adventure games moved away from including the text interface and simply provided appropriate commands the player could interact with onscreen the first known game with such an interface was enchanted scepters 1984 from silicon beach software which used dropdown menus for the player to select actions from while using a text window to describe results of those actions graphical adventure games were considered to have spurred the gaming market for personal computers from 1985 through the next decade as they were able to offer narratives and storytelling that could not readily be told by the state of graphical hardware at the time expansion 19902000 graphical adventure games would continue to improve with advances in graphic systems for home computers providing more detailed and colorful scenes and characters with the adoption of cdrom in the early 1990s it became possible to include higher quality graphics video and audio in adventure games myst used highquality 3d rendered graphics to deliver images that were unparalleled at the time of its release myst released in 1993 by cyan worlds is considered one of the genres more influential titles myst included prerendered 3d graphics video and audio decline 20002010 whereas once adventure games were one of the most popular genres for computer games by the mid1990s the market share started to drastically decline the forementioned saturation of mystlike games on the market led to little innovation in the field and a drop in consumer confidence in the genre this slump in popularity led many publishers and developers to see adventure games as financially unfeasible in comparison notably sierra was sold to cuc international in 1998 and while still a separate studio attempted to recreate an adventure game using 3d graphics kings quest mask of eternity as well as gabriel knight 3 both of which fared poorly the studio was subsequently closed in 1999 similarly lucasarts released grim fandango to many positive reviews but poor sales it released one more title escape from monkey island in 2000 but subsequently stopped development of sam max freelance police and had no further plans for adventure games traditional adventure games became difficult to propose as new commercial titles gilbert wrote in 2005 from firsthand experience i can tell you that if you even utter the words adventure game in a meeting with a publisher you can just pack up your spiffy concept art and leave youd get a better reaction by announcing that you have the plague similar to the fate of interactive fiction conventional graphical adventure games have continued to thrive in the amateur scene this has been most prolific with the tool adventure game studio ags some notable ags games include those by ben croshaw namely the chzo mythos ben jordan paranormal investigator time gentlemen please soviet unterzoegersdorf metal dead and agd interactives sierra adventure remakes adobe flash is also a popular tool known for adventures such as motas and the escape the room genre entries new platforms and rebirth 2005onward following the demise of the adventure genre in the early 2000s a number of events have occurred that have led to a revitalization of the adventure game genre as commercially viable the introduction of new computing and gaming hardware and software delivery formats and the use of crowdfunding as a means of achieving funding the 2000s saw the growth of digital distribution and the arrival of smartphones and tablet computers with touchscreen interfaces wellsuited to pointandclick adventure games the introduction of larger and more powerful touch screen devices like the ipad allowed for more detailed graphics more precise controls and a better sense of immersion and interactivity compared to personal computer or console versions further the improvements in digital distribution led to the concept of episodic adventure games delivering between three and five chapters of a full game over a course of several months via online storefronts steam xbox live marketplace playstation store and nintendo eshop modeled off the idea of televisions episodes episodic adventure games break the story into several parts giving players a chance to digest and discuss the current story with others before the next episode is available and further can enhance the narrative by creating cliffhangers or other dramatic elements to be resolved in later episodes meanwhile another avenue for adventure game rebirth came from the discovery of the influence of crowdfunding some of these include armikrog broken sword the serpents curse dreamfall chapters gabriel knight leisure suit larry reloaded moebius empire rising obduction spaceventure tesla effect a

pc9801 1982 platforms which could display 8 simultaneous colors and had a resolution of 640400 higher than western computers at the time in order to accommodate japanese text this in turn influenced game design as nec pcs became known for adventure games with detailed color graphics which would eventually evolve into visual novels nec soon had several competitors such as the fm7 1982 the av 1985 version of which could display more than 4000 colors in addition to featuring fm synthesis sound its 16bit successor the fm towns 1989 could display 24bit color 168 million colors and featured a cdrom

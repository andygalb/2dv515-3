history origins original ps logo playstation was the brainchild of ken kutaragi a sony executive who had just finished managing one of the companys hardware engineering divisions at that time and would later be dubbed as the father of the playstation the consoles origins date back to 1988 where it was originally a joint project between nintendo and sony to create a cdrom for the super famicom at that time negotiations were still ongoing between nintendo and sony with nintendo offering sony a nongaming role regarding their new partnership with philips this proposal was swiftly rejected by kutaragi who was facing increasing criticism over his work with regard to entering the video game industry from within sony negotiations officially ended in may 1992 and in order to decide the fate of the playstation project a meeting was held in june 1992 consisting of sony president ohga playstation head kutaragi and several senior members of sonys board at the meeting kutaragi unveiled a proprietary cdrombased system he had been working on which involved playing video games with 3d graphics to the board eventually sony president ohga decided to retain the project after being reminded by kutaragi of the humiliation he suffered from nintendo nevertheless due to strong opposition from a majority present at the meeting as well as widespread internal opposition to the project by the older generation of sony executives kutaragi and his team had to be shifted from sonys headquarters to sony music a completely separate financial entity owned by sony so as to retain the project and maintain relationships with philips for the mmcd development project which helped lead to the creation of the dvd according to sces producer ryoji akagawa and chairman shigeo maruyama there was uncertainty over whether the console should primarily focus on 2d sprite graphics or 3d polygon graphics it was only after witnessing the success of segas virtua fighter in japanese arcades that the direction of the playstation became instantly clear and 3d polygon graphics became the consoles primary focus formation of sony computer entertainment at sony music entertainment kutaragi worked closely with shigeo maruyama the ceo of sony music and with akira sato to form sony computer entertainment inc scei on november 16 1993 which was the mother company for the 1994founded sony computer entertainment of america scea the playstation project sceis first official project was finally given the green light by sony executives in 1993 after a few years of development also in 1993 phil

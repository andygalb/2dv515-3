music storytelling pixel art video game artists video games portalvte video game music is the soundtrack that accompanies video games early video game music was once limited to simple melodies of early sound synthesizer technology these limitations inspired the style of music known as chiptunes which combines simple melodic styles with more complex patterns or traditional music styles and became the most popular sound of the first video games with advances in technology video game music has now grown to include the same breadth and complexity associated with television and film scores allowing for much more creative freedom todays soundtracks can also change depending on a players actions or situation such as indicating missed actions in rhythm games video game music can be one of two options original or licensed many of the most notable original game composers have been from japan including nobuo uematsu koji kondo yuzo koshiro yoko shimomura junichi masuda hip tanaka masato nakamura koichi sugiyama yasunori mitsuda michiru yamane yuu miyake takenobu mitsuyoshi manabu namiki shinji hosoe and hiroshi kawaguchi the popularity of video game music has expanded education and job opportunities generated awards and allowed video game soundtracks to be commercially sold and performed in concert history early video game technology and computer chip music see also chiptune and music macro language an original synthesized composition imitating early video game music problems playing this file see media help at the time video games had emerged as a popular form of entertainment in the late 1970s music was stored on physical medium in analog waveforms such as compact cassettes and phonograph records such components were expensive and prone to breakage under heavy use making them less than ideal for use in an arcade cabinet though in rare cases they were used journey a more affordable method of having music in a video game was to use digital means where a specific computer chip would change electrical impulses from computer code into analog sound waves on the fly for output on a speaker sound effects for the games were also generated in this fashion an early example of such an approach to video game music was the opening chiptune in tomohiro nishikados gun fight 1975 while this allowed for inclusion of music in early arcade video games it was usually monophonic looped or used sparingly between stages or at the start of a new game such as the namco titles pacman 1980 composed by toshio kai or pole position 1982 composed by nobuyuki ohnogi the decision to include any music into a video game meant that at some point it would have to be transcribed into computer code by a programmer whether or not the programmer had musical experience some music was original some was public domain music such as folk songs sound capabilities were limited the popular atari 2600 home system for example was capable of generating only two tones or notes at a time as advances were made in silicon technology and costs fell a definitively new generation of arcade machines and home consoles allowed for great changes in accompanying music in arcades machines based on the motorola 68000 cpu and accompanying various yamaha ym programmable sound generator sound chips allowed for several more tones or channels of sound sometimes eight or more the earliest known example of this was segas 1980 arcade game carnival which used an ay38910 chip to create an electronic rendition of the classical 1889 composition over the waves by juventino rosas konamis 1981 arcade game frogger introduced a dynamic approach to video game music using at least eleven different gameplay tracks in addition to levelstarting and game over themes which change according to the players actions this was further improved upon by namcos 1982 arcade game dig dug where the music stopped when the player stopped moving home console systems also had a comparable upgrade in sound ability beginning with the colecovision in 1982 capable of four channels however more notable was the japanese release of the famicom in 1983 which was later released in the us as the nintendo entertainment system in 1985 it was capable of five channels one being capable of simple pcm sampled sound the home computer commodore 64 released in 1982 was capable of early forms of filtering effects different types of waveforms and eventually the undocumented ability to play 4bit samples on a pseudo fourth sound channel its comparatively low cost made it a popular alternative to other home computers as well as its ability to use a tv for an affordable display monitor approach to game music development in this time period usually involved using simple tone generation andor frequency modulation synthesis to simulate instruments for melodies and use of a noise channel for simulating percussive noises early use of pcm samples in this era was limited to short sound bites monopoly or as an alternate for percussion sounds super mario bros 3 the music on home consoles often had to share the available channels with other sound effects for example if a laser beam was fired by a spaceship and the laser used a 1400hz square wave then the square wave channel that was in use by music would stop playing music and start playing the sound effect the midtolate 1980s software releases for these platforms had music developed by more people with greater musical experience than before quality of composition improved noticeably and evidence of the popularity of music of this time period remains even today composers who made a name for themselves with their software include koichi sugiyama dragon quest the golden joystick awards introduced a category for best soundtrack of the year in 1986 won by sanxion some games for cartridge systems have been sold with extra audio hardware on board including pitfall ii for the atari 2600 and several late famicom titles these chips add to the existing sound capabilities early digital synthesis and sampling see also chiptune from around 1980 some arcade games began taking steps toward digitized or sampled sounds namcos 1980 arcade game rallyx was the first known game to use a digitaltoanalog converter dac to produce sampled tones instead of a tone generator beyond arcade games significant improvements to personal computer game music were made possible with the introduction of digital fm synth boards which yamaha released for japanese computers such as the nec pc8801 and pc9801 in the early 1980s and by the mid1980s the pc8801 and fm7 had builtin fm sound this allowed computer game music to have greater complexity than the simplistic beeps from internal speakers these fm synth boards produced a warm and pleasant sound that musicians such as yuzo koshiro and takeshi abo utilized to produce music that is still highly regarded within the chiptune community one of the earliest home computers to make use of digital signal processing in the form of sampling was the commodore amiga in 1985 the computers sound chip featured four independent 8bit digitaltoanalog converters developers could use this platform to take samples of a music performance sometimes just a single note long and play it back through the computers sound chip from memory this differed from rallyx in that its hardware dac was used to play back simple waveform samples and a sampled sound allowed for a complexity and authenticity of a real instrument that an fm simulation could not offer for its role in being one of the first and affordable the amiga would remain a staple tool of early sequenced music composing especially in europe the amiga offered these features before most other competing home computer platforms though the macintosh which had been introduced a year earlier had similar capabilities the amigas main rival the atari st sourced the yamaha ym2149 programmable sound generator psg compared to the inhouse designed amiga sound engine the psg could only handle 1 channel of sampled sound and needed the computers cpu to process the data for it this made it impractical for game development use until 1989 with the release of the atari ste which used dma techniques to play back pcm samples at up to 50khz the st however remained relevant as it was equipped with a midi controller and external ports it became the choice of by many professional musicians as a midi programming device ibm pc clones in 1985 would not see any significant development in multimedia abilities for a few more years and sampling would not become popular in other video game systems for several years though sampling had the potential to produce much more realistic sounds each sample required much more data in memory this was at a time when all memory solid state rom cartridge magnetic floppy disk or otherwise was still very costly per kilobyte sequenced soundchip generated music on the other hand was generated with a few lines of comparatively simple code and took up far less precious memory arcade systems pushed game music forward in 1984 with the introduction of fm frequency modulation synthesis providing more realistic sounds than previous psgs the first such game marble madness used the yamaha ym2151 fm synthesis chip as home consoles moved into the fourth generation or 16bit era the hybrid approach sampled and tone to music composing continued to be used the sega genesis offered advanced graphics over the nes and improved sound synthesis features also using a yamaha chip the ym2612 as cost of magnetic memory declined in the form of diskettes the evolution of video game music on the amiga and some years later game music development in general shifted to sampling in some form it took some years before amiga game designers learned to wholly use digitized sound effects in music an early exception case was the title music of text adventure game the pawn 1986 by this time computer and game music had already begun to form its own identity and thus many music makers intentionally tried to produce music that sounded like that heard on the commodore 64 and nes which resulted in the chiptune genre the release of a freelydistributed amiga program named soundtracker by karsten obarski in 1987 started the era of modformat which made it easy for anyone to produce music based on digitized samples module files were made with programs called trackers after obarskis soundtracker this modtracker tradition continued with pc computers in the 1990s examples of amiga games using digitized instrument samples include david whittakers soundtrack for shadow of the beast chris hlsbecks soundtrack for turrican 2 and matt furnisss tunes for laser squad richard joseph also composed some theme songs featuring vocals and lyrics for games by sensible software most famous being cannon fodder 1993 with a song war has never been so much fun and sensible world of soccer 1994 with a song goal scoring superstar hero these songs used long vocal samples a similar approach to sound and music developments had become common in the arcades by this time and had been used in many arcade system boards since the mid1980s this was further popularized in the early 1990s by games like street fighter ii 1991 on the cps1 which used voice samples extensively along with sampled sound effects and percussion neo geos mvs system also carried powerful sound development which often included surround sound the super nes 1990 brought digitized sound to console games the evolution also carried into home console video games such as the release of the super famicom in 1990 and its useu version super nes in 1991 it sported a specialized custom sony chip for both the sound generation and for special hardware dsp it was capable of eight channels of sampled sounds at up to 16bit resolution had a wide selection of dsp effects including a type of adsr usually seen in high end synthesizers of the time and full stereo sound this allowed experimentation with applied acoustics in video games such as musical acoustics early games like super castlevania iv fzero final fantasy iv gradius iii and later games like chrono trigger directional star fox and spatial acoustics dolby pro logic was used in some games like king arthurs world and jurassic park as well as environmental and architectural acoustics zelda iii secret of evermore many games also made heavy use of the high quality sample playback capabilities super star wars tales of phantasia the only real limitation to this powerful setup was the stillcostly solid state memory other consoles of the generation could boast similar abilities yet did not have the same circulation levels as the super nes the neogeo home system was capable of the same powerful sample processing as its arcade counterpart but was several times the cost of a super nes the sega cd the mega cd outside north america hardware upgrade to the mega drive genesis in the us offered multiple pcm channels but they were often passed over instead to use its capabilities with the cdrom itself popularity of the super nes and its software remained limited to regions where ntsc television was the broadcast standard partly because of the difference in frame rates of pal broadcast equipment many titles released were never redesigned to play appropriately and ran much slower than had been intended or were never released this showed a divergence in popular video game music between pal and ntsc countries that still shows to this day this divergence would be lessened as the fifth generation of home consoles launched globally and as commodore began to take a back seat to general purpose pcs and macs for developing and gaming though the mega cdsega cd and to a greater extent the pc engine in japan would give gamers a preview of the direction video game music would take in streaming music the use of both sampled and sequenced music continues in game consoles even today the huge data storage benefit of optical media would be coupled with progressively more powerful audio generation hardware and higher quality samples in the fifth generation in 1994 the cdrom equipped playstation supported 24 channels of 16bit samples of up to 441khz sample rate samples equal to cd audio in quality it also sported a few hardware dsp effects like reverb many square titles continued to use sequenced music such as final fantasy vii legend of mana and final fantasy tactics the sega saturn also with a cd drive supported 32 channels of pcm at the same resolution as the original playstation in 1996 the nintendo 64 still using a solid state cartridge actually supported an integrated and scalable sound system that was potentially capable of 100 channels of pcm and an improved sample rate of 48khz games for the n64 because of the cost of the solid state memory typically had samples of lesser quality than the other two however and music tended to be simpler in construct the more dominant approach for games based on cds however was shifting toward streaming audio midi on the pc the first developers of ibm pc computers neglected audio capabilities first ibm model 1981 in the same timeframe of the late 1980s to mid1990s the ibm pc clones using the x86 architecture became more ubiquitous yet had a very different path in sound design than other pcs and consoles early pc gaming was limited to the pc speaker and some proprietary standards such as the ibm pcjr 3voice chip while sampled sound could be achieved on the pc speaker using pulse width modulation doing so required a significant proportion of the available processor power rendering its use in games rare with the increase of x86 pcs in the market there was a vacuum in sound performance in home computing that expansion cards attempted to fill the first two recognizable standards were the roland mt32 followed by the adlib sound card rolands solution was driven by midi sequencing using advanced la synthesizers this made it the first choice for game developers to produce upon but its higher cost as an enduser solution made it prohibitive the adlib used a lowcost fm synthesis chip from yamaha and many boards could operate compatibly using the midi standard the adlib card was usurped in 1989 by creatives sound blaster which used the same yamaha fm chip in the adlib for compatibility but also added 8bit 2205khz later 441khz digital audio recording and playback of a single stereo channel as an affordable enduser product the sound blaster constituted the core sound technology of the early 1990s a combination of a simple fm engine that supported midi and a dac engine of one or more streams only a minority of developers ever used amigastyle tracker formats in commercial pc games unreal typically preferring to use the mt32 or adlibsbcompatible devices as general purpose pcs using x86 became more ubiquitous than the other pc platforms developers drew their focus towards that platform the last major development before streaming music came in 1992 roland corporation released the first general midi card the samplebased scc1 an addin card version of the sc55 desktop midi module the comparative quality of the samples spurred similar offerings from soundblaster but costs for both products were still high both companies offered daughterboards with samplebased synthesizers that could be later added to a less expensive soundcard which only had a dac and a midi controller to give it the features of a fully integrated card unlike the standards of amiga or atari a pc using x86 even then could be using a broad mix of hardware developers increasingly used midi sequences instead of writing soundtrack data for each type of soundcard they generally wrote a fully featured data set for the roland application that would be compatible with lesser featured equipment so long as it had a midi controller to run the sequence however different products used different sounds attached to their midi controllers some tied into the yamaha fm chip to simulate instruments some daughterboards of samples had very different sound qualities meaning that no single sequence performance would be accurate to every other general midi device all of these considerations in the products reflected the high cost of memory storage which rapidly declined with the optical cd format prerecorded and streaming music streaming audio in video games taking entirely prerecorded music had many advantages over sequencing for sound quality music could be produced freely with any kind and number of instruments allowing developers to simply record one track to be played back during the game quality was only limited by the effort put into mastering the track itself memory space costs that was previously a concern was somewhat addressed with optical media becoming the dominant media for software games cd quality audio allowed for music and voice that had the potential to be truly indistinguishable from any other source or genre of music in fourth generation home video games and pcs this was limited to playing a mixed mode cd audio track from a cd while the game was in play such as sonic cd the earliest examples of mixed mode cd audio in video games include the turbografxcd rpg franchises tengai maky composed by ryuichi sakamoto from 1989 however there were several disadvantages of regular cdaudio optical drive technology was still limited in spindle speed so playing an audio track from the game cd meant that the system could not access data again until it stopped the track from playing looping the most common form of game music was also problem as when the laser reached the end of a track it had to move itself back to the beginning to start reading again causing an audible gap in playback to address these drawbacks some pc game developers designed their own container formats in house for each application in some cases to stream compressed audio this would cut back on memory used for music on the cd allowed for much lower latency and seek time when finding and starting to play music and also allowed for much smoother looping due to being able to buffer the data a minor drawback was that use of compressed audio meant it had to be decompressed which put load on the cpu of a system as computing power increased this load became minimal and in some cases dedicated chips in a computer such as a sound card would actually handle all the decompressing fifth generation home console systems also developed specialised streaming formats and containers for compressed audio playback games would take full advantage of this ability sometimes with highly praised results castlevania symphony of the night games ported from arcade machines which continued to use fm synthesis often saw superior prerecorded music streams on their home console counterparts street fighter alpha 2 even though the game systems were capable of cd quality sound these compressed audio tracks were not true cd quality many of them had lower sampling rates but not so significant that most consumers would notice using a compressed stream allowed game designers to play back streamed music and still be able to access other data on the disc without interruption of the music at the cost of cpu power used to render the audio stream manipulating the stream any further would require a far more significant level of cpu power available in the 5th generation some games such as the wipeout series continued to use full mixed mode cd audio for their soundtracks this overall freedom offered to music composers gave video game music the equal footing with other popular music it had lacked a musician could now with no need to learn about programming or the game architecture itself independently produce the music to their satisfaction this flexibility would be exercised as popular mainstream musicians would be using their talents for video games specifically an early example is way of the warrior on the 3do with music by white zombie a more wellknown example is trent reznors score for quake an alternate approach as with the tmnt arcade was to take preexisting music not written exclusively for the game and use it in the game the game star wars xwing vs tie fighter and subsequent star wars games took music composed by john williams for the star wars films of the 1970s and 1980s and used it for the game soundtracks both using new music streams made specifically for the game and using previously releasedrecorded music streams are common approaches for developing sound tracks to this day it is common for xgames sportsbased video games to come with some popular artists recent releases ssx tony hawk initial d as well as any game with heavy cultural demographic theme that has tiein to music need for speed underground gran turismo and grand theft auto sometimes a hybrid of the two are used such as in dance dance revolution sequencing samples continue to be used in modern gaming for many uses mostly rpgs sometimes a cross between sequencing samples and streaming music is used games such as republic the revolution music composed by james hannigan and command conquer generals music composed by bill brown have utilised sophisticated systems governing the flow of incidental music by stringing together short phrases based on the action on screen and the players most recent choices see dynamic music other games dynamically mixed the sound on the game based on cues of the game environment as processing power increased dramatically in the 6th generation of home consoles it became possible to apply special effects in realtime to streamed audio in ssx a recent video game series if a snowboarder takes to the air after jumping from a ramp the music softens or muffles a bit and the ambient noise of wind and air blowing becomes louder to emphasize being airborne when the snowboarder lands the music resumes regular playback until its next cue the lucasarts company pioneered this interactive music technique with their imuse system used in their early adventure games and the star wars flight simulators star wars xwing and star wars tie fighter action games such as these will change dynamically to match the amount of danger stealthbased games will sometimes rely on such music either by handling streams differently or dynamically changing the composition of a sequenced soundtrack personalized soundtracks being able to play ones own music during a game in the past usually meant turning down the game audio and using an alternative music player some early exceptions were possible on pcwindows gaming in which it was possible to independently adjust game audio while playing music with a separate program running in the background some pc games such as quake play music from the cd while retrieving game data exclusively from the hard disk thereby allowing the game cd to be swapped for any music cd the first pc game to introduce ingame support for custom soundtracks was lionhead studios black and white the 2001 game included an ingame interface for winamp that enabled the players to play audio tracks from their own playlists in addition this would sometimes trigger various reactions from the players creature like dancing or laughing some playstation games supported this by swapping the game cd with a music cd although when the game needed data players had to swap the cds again one of the earliest games ridge racer was loaded entirely into ram letting the player insert a music cd to provide a soundtrack throughout the entirety of the gameplay in vib ribbon this became a gameplay feature with the game generating levels based entirely on the music on whatever cd the player inserted microsofts xbox allowed music to be copied from a cd onto its internal hard drive to be used as a custom soundtrack if enabled by the game developer the feature carried over into the xbox 360 where it became supported by the system software and could be enabled at any point the wii is also able to play custom soundtracks if it is enabled by the game excite truck the playstation portable can in games like need for speed carbon own the city and fifa 08 play music from a memory stick the playstation 3 has the ability to utilize custom soundtracks in games using music saved on the hard drive however few game developers used this function mlb 08 the show released in 2008 has a my mlb sound track feature which allows the user to play music tracks of their choice saved on the hard drive of their ps3 rather than the preprogrammed tracks incorporated into the game by the developer an update to wipeout hd released on the playstation network was made to also incorporate this feature in the video game audiosurf custom soundtracks are the main aspect of the game users have to pick a music file to be analyzed the game will generate a race track based on tempo pitch and complexity of the sound the user will then race on this track synchronized with the music games in the grand theft auto series have supported custom soundtracks using them as a separate ingame radio station the feature was primarily exclusive to pc versions and was adopted to a limited degree on console platforms on a pc inserting custom music into the stations is done by placing music files into a designated folder for the xbox version a cd must be installed into the consoles hard drive for the iphone version of grand theft auto chinatown wars players create an itunes playlist which is then played by the game forza horizon 3 used a similar technology of custom soundtracks with the help of groove music developments in the 2000s this section possibly contains original research please

playstation 3 handles multiple types of surround sound technology including dolby truehd and dtshd with up to 71 channels and with sampling rates of up to 192khz nintendos wii console shares many audio components with the nintendo gamecube from the previous generation including dolby pro logic ii these features are extensions of technology already currently in use the game developer of today has many choices on how to develop music more likely changes in video game music creation will have very little to do with technology and more to do with other factors of game development as a business whole video game music has diversified much to the point where scores for games can be presented with a full orchestra or simple 816bit chiptunes this degree of freedom has made the creative possibilities of video game music limitless to developers as sales of video game music diverged from the game itself in the west compared to japan where game music cds had been selling for years business elements also wield a new level of influence music from outside the game developers immediate employment such as music composers and pop artists have been contracted to produce game music just as they would for a theatrical movie many other factors have growing influence such as editing for content politics on some level of the development and executive input game music as a genre see also chiptune this section possibly contains original research please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations statements consisting only of original research should be removed august 2014 learn how and when to remove this template message many games for the nintendo entertainment system and other early game consoles feature a similar style of musical composition that is sometimes described as the video game genre some aspects of this style continue to influence certain music today though gamers do not associate many modern game soundtracks with the older style the genres compositional elements largely developed due to technological restraints while also being influenced by electronic music bands particularly yellow magic orchestra ymo who were popular during the late 1970s to 1980s features of the video game music genre include pieces designed to repeat indefinitely rather than having an arranged ending or fading out pieces lacking lyrics and playing over gameplay sounds limited polyphony only three notes can be played simultaneously on the nintendo entertainment system a great deal of effort was put into composition to create the illusion of more notes playing at once although the tones featured in nes music can be thought of emulating a traditional fourpiece rock band triangle wave used as a bass two pulse waves analogous to two guitars and a white noise channel used for drums composers would often go out of their way to compose complex and rapid sequences of notes in part due to the restrictions mentioned above this is similar to music composition during the baroque period when composers particularly when creating solo pieces focused on musical embellishments to compensate for instruments such as the harpsichord that do not allow for expressive dynamics for the same reason many early compositions also feature a distinct jazz influence these would overlap with later influences from heavy metal and jpop music resulting in an equally distinct compositional style in the 16bit era in an unrelated but parallel course in the european and north american developer scene similar limitations were driving the musical style of home computer games module file format music particularly mod used similar techniques but was more heavily influenced from the electronic music scene as it developed and resulted in another very distinct subgenre demos and the developing demoscene played a big part in the early years and still influence video game music today as technological limitations gradually lifted composers were given more freedom and with the advent of cdrom prerecorded soundtracks came to dominate resulting in a noticeable shift in composition and voicing style as the divisions between movies and video games has blurred so have divisions between film scores and video game scores adventure and fantasy movies have similar needs to adventure and fantasy games ie fanfare traveling heros theme and so on some composers have written scores in both genres one noted example is us composer michael giacchino who composed the soundtrack for the game medal of honor and later composed for the television series lost and wrote scores for movies such as the incredibles 2004 and star trek 2009 outside of video games see also chiptune appreciation for video game music is strong among fans and composers particularly for music from the third and fourth generations of home video game consoles and sometimes newer generations this appreciation has been shown outside the context of a video game in the form of cds sheet music public performances art installations and popular music cds and sheet music selling video game soundtracks separately as cds has become increasingly popular in the industry koichi sugiyama was an early figure in this practice and following the release of the first dragon quest game in 1986 a live performance cd of his compositions was released and performed by the london philharmonic orchestra then later by other groups including the tokyo philharmonic orchestra and nhk symphony yuzo koshiro another early figure released a live performance of the actraiser soundtrack both koshiros and fellow falcom composer mieko ishikawas contributions to ys music would have such long lasting impact that there were more albums released of ys music than of almost all other gametype music like anime soundtracks these soundtracks and even sheet music books were usually marketed exclusively in japan therefore interested nonjapanese gamers had to import the soundtracks andor sheet music books through on or offline firms specifically dedicated to video game soundtrack imports this has been somewhat less of an issue more recently as domestic publishers of anime and video games have been producing western equivalent versions of the osts for sale in uk and us though these are often for more popular titles the sale of video game soundtracks has created a growing symbiotic relationship between the music industry and the games industry public performance many original composers have publicly exhibited their music through symphonic concert performances once again koichi sugiyama was the first to execute this practice in 1987 with his family classic concert and has continued these concert performances almost annually in 1991 he also formed a series called orchestral game music concerts notable for featuring other talented game composers such as yoko kanno nobunagas ambition romance of the three kingdoms uncharted waters nobuo uematsu final fantasy keiichi suzuki motherearthbound and kentaro haneda wizardry following suit compositions by nobuo uematsu on final fantasy iv were arranged into final fantasy iv celtic moon a live performance by string musicians with strong celtic influence recorded in ireland the love theme from the same game has been used as an instructional piece of music in japanese schools with the success of squares

popularity on august 20 2003 music written for video games such as final fantasy and the legend of zelda was performed for the first time outside japan by the czech national symphony orchestra in a

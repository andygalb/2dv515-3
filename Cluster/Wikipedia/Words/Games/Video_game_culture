electronic sports is becoming more widely accepted today video games can be seen in social media politics television film music and youtube demographics see also women and video games as of 2016 one possible reason for the increase in players could be attributed to the growing number of genres that require less of a specific audience for example the wii console has widened its audience with games such as wii sports and wii fit both require more activity from the user and provide more reasons to play including family competition or exercise it could also be because people who played video games when they were young are now growing older and still have that interest in video games currently the largest entertainment industry for children is gaming according to a 2008 telephone survey with a sample size of 1102 respondents 97 of children living in the united states and between the ages of 12 and 17 play video games as displayed by the recent release of certain games games designed to appeal to player 2 offer gamers an alternative gaming experience thus allowing for the further demographic expansion of the video game subculture lan gaming lan party video games are played in a variety of social ways which often involve domestic gatherings or even in public places a popular method of accomplishing this is a lan local area network party which if hosted at a home involves family and friends creating a social event for people friendly with each other lan parties are often held in largescale events conducted in public spaces and have a great number of participants who might not usually socialise the everquest fan faires for instance provide weekends of socializing and playing at a large gathering an event of several thousands of dedicated game fans terry flew in

communities satisfy a genuine need for affiliation with likeminded others online gaming online game see also voice chat in online gaming online gaming has drastically increased the scope and size of gaming culture online gaming grew out of games on bulletin board systems and on college mainframes from the 1970s and 1980s muds offered multiplayer competition and cooperation but on a scope more geographically limited than on the internet the internet allowed gamers from all over the world not just within one country or state to play games together with ease with the advent of cloud gaming highperformance games can now be played from lowend client systems and even tvs one of the most groundbreaking titles in the history of online gaming is quake which offered the ability to play with sixteen and eventually up to thirtytwo players simultaneously in a 3d world gamers quickly began to establish their own organized groups called clans clans established their own identities their own marketing their own form of internal organization and even their own looks some clans had friendly or hostile rivalries and there were often clans who were allied with other clans clan interaction took place on both professionally set competition events and during normal casual playing where several members of one clan would play on a public server clans would often do their recruiting this way by noticing the best players on a particular server they would send invitations for that player to either try out or accept membership in the clan gamers of all ages play online games with the average age being 31 years old clan or guildbased play has since become an accepted and expected aspect of multiplayer gaming with several games offering cashprize tournamentstyle competition to their players many clans and guilds also have active fanbases which when combined with the tournament aspect contribute in turning clanbased gaming into a semiprofessional sport clans also allow players to assist each other in simulated combat and quests in game advancement as well as providing an online family for friendly socialising from quake gaming grew beyond firstperson shooters and has impacted every genre realtime strategy racing games card games sports games can all be played online online gaming has spread from its initial computer roots to console gaming as well today every major video game console available offers degrees of online gaming some limited by particular titles some even offer up entire virtual communities competition esports slang and terminology the dreamhack lan party as in other cultures the community has developed a gamut of slang words or phrases that can be used for communication in or outside of games due to their growing online nature modern video game slang overlaps heavily with internet slang as well as leetspeak with many words such pwn as well as noob being direct carryovers from leetspeak there are terms to describe gaming events games genres gamer demographics strategies specific events situations and more it is especially common among online games to encourage the use of neologisms for convenience in communication while most games have specific terms that the dedicated player bases use some of the most prevalent phrases across all communities include abbreviations such as lol meaning laughing out loud as well as noob which is a derogatory term for a new or unskillful player another popular term that stemmed from the gaming community is the abbreviation afk meaning away from keyboard to refer to people who are not at the computer or paying attention another common abbreviations include gl hf which stands for good luck have fun which is often said at the beginning of a match to show good sportmanship likewise at the end of a game gg or gg wp may be said to congratulate the opponent win or loss on a good game well played while much of gaming lingo uses abbreviations for convenience a lot of jargon is used for cyberbullying in cases of online games with text or voice chat channels it is not uncommon for players to blame or insult one another using such jargon some additional examples of slang and terminology include rekt slang for wrecked is often used to point out the obvious when a player or entity is destroyed less commonly own ownage owned or pwned is used in a similar fashion gaming networks the shift from consolebased or shrinkwrap gaming to online games compared to past eras where consumers had little means of communication with game developers and other communities beyond their geographical location the internet has created many methods of communication such as through the online bulletin board website reddit gamers can often develop sub communities in game clans and may use third party voip programs to communicate while playing games such as skype ventrillo teamspeak or discord these gaming communities may have nothing in common or instead designed for dedicated skilled players or even clans made for those with shared commonalities such as personality ethnicity heritage language or gender another key component of many gaming networks is the connection between the player base and the game developers many game developers have outlets either through official website forums or social media where gamers can communicate with and provide feedback to the game developers likewise these same places become key locations for game developers to communicate with their fans where often dedicated employees act as liaisons as a bridge between the company and the community some of the most advanced networks take place with massivelymultiplayer online gaming where servers of tens of thousands can be present simultaneously in the same instance or environment in major titles such as world of warcraft and dota 2 the player base is in the millions with so many people many of these communities may develop virtual economies that may use a barter system or currency system in some games the interest in the virtual economies may be so great players will spend real money through auction sites like ebay for virtual property and items commonly known as rmt real market trading some game developers may ban rmt in their games especially when it interferes with the equity of the game that being said other game developers embrace it with one game second life with its entire focus on the usage of reallife currency for everything in the game world since smartphones became commonplace around 2007 mobile gaming has seen rapid increases in popularity the widespread appeal of simple timekilling games reminiscent of social games such as those found on facebook has set the stage for mobile gaming to account for almost 35 of gamings total market share by 2017 because games such as clash of clans offer ingame bonuses for referring new players to the game mobile gamers have turned to social media sites to recruit their friends and family some games even offer integrated social media support to provide players with ingame chat or friends features for communicating and competing with other players social or antisocial technology this section may be unbalanced towards certain viewpoints please improve the article by adding information on neglected viewpoints or discuss the issue on the talk page november 2016 there has been much debate among media theorists as to whether video gaming is an inherently social or antisocial activity terry flew argues that digital games are increasingly social a trend that works against the mainstream medias portrayal of players as isolated usually adolescent boys hidden away in darkened bedrooms failing to engage with the social world he asserts that games are played in very social and public settings for example computers and consoles are often played in living areas of domestic homes where people play with family or friends david marshall argues against the rich source of effects based research finding that games are deliberating and antisocial forms of behaviour gosney argues that alternate reality gaming is also inherently social drawing upon pierre levys levy 1998 notion of collective intelligence he states that the game relied upon an unprecedented level of corroboration and collective intelligence to solve the game the issue of collective and corroborative team play is essential to arg thus are anything but a solitary activity hans geser further rejects the mainstream media view that video gaming is an antisocial activity asserting there is considerable empirical evidence that second life serves mainly to widen the life experience of individuals who have already a rich first life not as a compensating device for marginal loners social implications of video games see also video game controversy the advent of video games gave an innovative media technology that allowed consumers to archive annotate appropriate and recirculate media content consumers can use this media source as an alternative tool to gain access to information of their interest the community aspect to videogaming has also had implications for the social interactions and collective behaviours of consumers involved in the activity rise of subcultures contemporary investigations have found that there is a prevailing social framework in place during gatherings of gaming enthusiasts or gamers in response to the central importance that food plays in the collective enjoyment of social gaming various websites have been created which allow gamers to rate their favorite foods to accompany play the presence of rituals shared discourse collective action and even a liminal food culture among gaming communities gives credence to the concept of these cohorts existing as self defining subunits within mainstream culture however due to the ephemeral and transient nature of their rituals and also the possibility of virtual interaction through online participation these cohorts should be considered postmodern subcultures gaming communities have social elements beyond physical interaction and have come to a stage where online and offline spaces can be seen as merged rather than separate mmorpg and identity tourism terry flew 2005p264 enjoy adopting what they feel to be an image of femininity more acceptable or desirable than their real world body this is what he calls identity tourism a form of hopping from one person to another for which there usually is a stereotypical discourse associated with the protagonist this is seen in the case of males who assume the personas of the female gender and the characters representation of her gender being overly sexualized andor passive this tends to perpetuate and accentuate existing stereotypes of women nakamura ownership ownership of video game entities is a major issue in video game culture violence narrative violent content in video game are often a source of criticism which according to terry flew is related to the subject of moral panic terry flew writes that the effectsbased research which gives rise to the computer games cause violence discourse is mostly psychologybased research influenced particularly after horrific events such as the shooting of schoolchildren at columbine high school in littleton colorado in 1999 he says that the assumption behind such research causeeffect behaviorist models of communication is a flawed one several studies show a correlation between violent content conveyed through media including videogames and violent or aggressive behavior while others vastag 2004 consider that the evidence for such conclusions is thin and highly contestable fox news reported that montreal shooting case in canada was carried out by the criminal kimveer gill

video game creators and players issues related to women and video games including sexism in video gaming and gender representation in video games have received increased attention by academia the media the games industry and by gamers themselves the gamergate controversy of 2014 which involves issues of sexism misogyny and journalistic ethics is an example of this benjamin paaen has argued that because video game culture has long been a space dominated by heterosexual men the video game industry tends to cater to this particularly lucrative audience producing video games that reflect the desires of the heterosexual male gaze he further argues that this lack of representation of alternate identities in video games has caused gamers who divert from the dominant demographic are often relegated to the margins of the culture this process is thus seen perpetuates the stereotypical image of the geeky heterosexual male gamer as the ruler of the gaming world contrarily to popular belief there are a multitude of communities within video game culture that do not fulfill the typical gamer stereotype the problem is that they lack visibility one reason for this is that many people do not want to reveal their association with gaming culture out of fear of stigmatization past research has shown this to be the case for many female gamers because women in gaming are often ostracized by their male gamer counterparts female gamers are frequently forced to conceal their genders only participating in gaming when they have the ability to remain anonymous additionally dominant perceptions of gamers as asocial straight white men are also challenged by the presence of gamers who do not identify as heterosexual for instance it has been shown by past research that the lgbtq community maintains a notable presence within video game culture for lgbtq gamers video games provide an alternate reality in which there is the opportunity for sexual expression identity formation and community building such communities indicate the development of diverse subcultures within the culture of gaming as a whole gaming and popular culture this section may lend undue weight to certain

band yellow magic orchestras selftitled album released in 1978 aphex twin an experimental electronic artist under the name powerpill released the pacman ep in 1992 that featured a heavy use of pacman sound effects an entire music genre called chiptunes or sometimes gamewave have artists dedicated to using the synthesizer sets that came with past video game consoles and computers particularly the commodore 64 and the nintendo entertainment system these bands include mr pacman 8 bit weapon goto 80 50 hertz and puss the influence of retro video games on contemporary music can also be seen in the work of less purist bitpop artists such as solemn camel crew and anamanaguchi moreover many gamers collect and listen to video game music ripped from the games themselves this music is known by its file extension and includes such formats as sid commodore 64 nsf nes and spc snes cover bands like minibosses perform their own instrumentations and groups like the protomen have written rock operas

they have often become the basis for hollywood movies the first movie based upon a video game was consistently denounced by critics it was 1993s super mario bros which featured john leguizamo and dennis hopper most film adaptions of other video games have been rated unfavorably as well and the adaptions often fail at the box office too 2001s lara croft tomb raider was successful at the box office despite poor reviews 274703340 usd gross revenue director uwe boll has become well known for his film adaptions of video games notorious for being poorly reviewed box office flops this was the case with bloodrayne which was reviewed terribly by critics and only grossed 3650275 usd a fraction of its 25 million budget the contributing factors to the unsuccessful transition from home television to theatre screens are attributed to a dramatic reenvisioning of the video game that provides a disconnect from the games plot the game itself lacking a plot rich enough to provide a decent script particularly with versus fighting games a substantially altered plot to make the movie more mainstream doom and an emphasis on using celebrity actors over actors that would fit the part examples street fighter mortal kombat bloodrayne doom house of the dead alone in the dark resident evil silent hill tomb raider assassins creed film movies about video games hollywood has also created

video game the plot revolves around about adolescents who compete at games for the nintendo entertainment system the film was also a first look at the megahit super mario bros 3 the main character from 2006s grandmas boy was a game tester who developed his own game on the side the film made multiple references to video game culture and featured the game demonik which was cancelled by its

and video game genre was the result of the multimedia expansion of computers and video game consoles in the mid1990s primarily because of the increased capacity offered by the laserdisc format interactive movies started out on arcade machines in 1983 but quickly expanded to computers and video game consoles such as the sega cd the phillips cdi and the 3do interactive multiplayer the games are characterized by more emphasis on cinematic sequences using fullmotion video and voice acting interactive movie games have been made in a number of genres including adventure games rail shooters and roleplaying games the first interactive movie game was dragons lair originally released in the arcades in 1983 making it the first game to use a laserdisc and animation by don bluth a man who worked for disney on features like robin hood the rescuers and petes dragon but later worked for other film companies like united artists all dogs go to heaven and universal studios the land before time in dragons lair you control the actions of a daring knight named dirk to save a princess from an evil dragon hence the name of the game since the dawn of this exact game more and more companies were influenced by the technology used and decided to make their own interactive movie games for arcades and consoles the birth of the interactive movie genre was studded with unimpressive flops though the genre later came into its own at the time videocapture technology was still in its infancy with short and often grainy and lowquality video segments being the norm for games of any length video game and traditional media forms with the rapid convergence of all media types into a digital form video games are also beginning to affect and be affected by traditional media forms in the history the television engineer ralph baer who conceived the idea of an interactive television while building a television set from scratch created the first video game video games are now also being exploited by paytv companies which allow you to simply attach your computer or console to the television cable system and you can simply download the latest game games act in television with the player choosing to enter the artificial world the constructed meanings in video games are more influential than those of traditional media forms the reason is that games interact with the audience in a dialogue of emotion action and reaction the interactivity means this occurs to a depth that is not possible in the traditional media forms computer games have developed in parallel to both the video game and the arcade video game the personal computer and console machines such as the dreamcast nintendo gamecube playstation 2 and xbox offered a new dimension to game playing the consoles have now largely been replaced by the xbox 360 wii and the playstation 4 and the personal computer is still a leading gaming machine games are the first new computerbased media form to socialize a generation of youth in a way that traditional media forms have in the past therefore the mtv generation has been overtaken by the nintendo generation however some refer to the current generation as the ipod

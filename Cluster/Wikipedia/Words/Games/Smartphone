smartphone smartphones redirects here for the song by trey songz see smartphones song not to be confused with telephone two smartphones a samsung galaxy j5 left and an iphone 6s right smartphones are a class of multipurpose mobile computing device they are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems which facilitate wider software internet including web browsing over mobile broadband and multimedia functionality including music video cameras and gaming alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging smartphones typically include various sensors that can be leveraged by their software such as a magnetometer proximity sensors barometer gyroscope and accelerometer and support wireless communications protocols such as bluetooth wifi and satellite navigation early smartphones were marketed primarily towards the enterprise market attempting to bridge the functionality of standalone personal digital assistant pda devices with support for cellular telephony but were limited by their battery life bulky form factors and the immaturity of wireless data services in the 2000s blackberry nokias symbian platform and windows phone began to gain market traction with models often featuring qwerty keyboards or resistive touchscreen input and emphasizing access to push email and wireless internet since the 2007 unveiling of the iphone the majority of smartphones have featured thin slatelike form factors with large capacitive screens with support for multitouch gestures rather than physical keyboards and offer the ability for users to download or purchase additional applications from a centralized store and use cloud storage and synchronization virtual assistants as well as mobile payment services improving hardware and faster wireless standards such as lte have bolstered the growth of the smartphone industry in the third quarter of 2012 one billion smartphones were in use worldwide history forerunner ibm simon and charging base 1994 the first commercially available device that could be properly referred to as a smartphone began as a prototype called angler developed by frank canova in 1992 while at ibm and demonstrated in november of that year at the comdex computer industry trade show early integration of data signals with telephony the first caller identification receiver 1971 the first integration of data signals with telephony was conceptualized by nikola tesla in 1909 and pioneered by theodore paraskevakos beginning in 1968 with his work on transmission of electronic data through telephone lines in 1971 while he was working with boeing in huntsville alabama paraskevakos demonstrated a transmitter and receiver that provided additional ways to communicate with remote equipment this formed the original basis for what is now known as caller id pdaphone hybrids personal digital assistant in the midlate 1990s many people who had mobile phones carried a separate dedicated pda device running early versions of operating systems such as palm os newton os symbian or windows cepocket pc these operating systems would later evolve into early mobile operating systems most of the smartphones in this era were hybrid devices that combined these existing familiar pda oses with basic phone hardware the results were devices that were bulkier than either dedicated mobile phones or pdas but allowed a limited amount of cellular internet access the trend at the time however that manufacturers competed on in both mobile phones and pdas was to make devices smaller and slimmer the bulk of these smartphones combined with their high cost and expensive data plans plus other drawbacks such as expansion limitations and decreased battery life compared to separate standalone devices generally limited their popularity to early adopters and business users who needed portable connectivity in march 1996 hewlettpackard released the omnigo 700lx a modified hp 200lx palmtop pc with a nokia 2110 mobile phone piggybacked onto it and rombased software to support it it had a 640200 resolution cga compatible fourshade grayscale lcd screen and could be used to place and receive calls and to create and receive text messages emails and faxes it was also 100 dos 50 compatible allowing it to run thousands of existing software titles including early versions of windows the nokia 9000 communicator right and the updated 9110 model left in august 1996 nokia released the nokia 9000 communicator a digital cellular pda based on the nokia 2110 with an integrated system based on the pengeos 30 operating system from geoworks the two components were attached by a hinge in what became known as a clamshell design with the display above and a physical qwerty keyboard below the pda provided email calendar address book calculator and notebook applications textbased web browsing and could send and receive faxes when closed the device could be used as a digital cellular telephone in june 1999 qualcomm released the pdq smartphone a cdma digital pcs smartphone with an integrated palm pda and internet connectivity subsequent landmark devices included the ericsson r380 2000 by ericsson mobile communications users could not install their own software on the device however the kyocera 6035 early 2001 a dualnature device with a separate palm os pda operating system and cdma mobile phone firmware it supported limited web browsing with the pda software treating the phone hardware as an attached modem handsprings treo 180 2002 the first smartphone that fully integrated the palm os on a gsm mobile phone having telephony sms messaging and internet access built in to the os the 180 model had a thumbtype keyboard and the 180g version had a graffiti handwriting recognition area instead japanese cell phones in 1999 japanese wireless provider ntt docomo launched imode a new mobile internet platform which provided data transmission speeds up to 96 kilobits per second and access web services available through the platform such as online shopping ntt docomos imode used chtml a language which restricted some aspects of traditional html in favor of increasing data speed for the devices limited functionality small screens and limited bandwidth allowed for phones to use the slower data speeds available the rise of imode helped ntt docomo accumulate an estimated 40 million subscribers by the end of 2001 and ranked first in market capitalization in japan and second globally this power would later wane in the face of the rise of 3g and new phones with advanced wireless network capabilities japanese cell phones increasingly diverged from global standards and trends to offer other forms of advanced services and functionality such as mobile payments nearfield communication nfc and 1seg mobile television early smartphones several blackberry smartphones which were highly popular in the midlate 2000s smartphones were still rare outside japan until the introduction of the danger hiptop in 2002 which saw moderate success among us consumers as the tmobile sidekick later in the mid2000s business users in the us started to adopt devices based on microsofts windows mobile and then blackberry smartphones from research in motion american users popularized the term crackberry in 2006 due to the blackberrys addictive nature outside the us and japan nokia was seeing success with its smartphones based on symbian originally developed by psion for their personal organisers and it was the most popular smartphone os in europe during the middle to late 2000s initially nokias symbian smartphones were focused on business with the eseries form factor shift the original apple iphone its introduction contributed to the steady rise of smartphones that feature large touchscreen interfaces without physical keypads in the 2000s it was common for smartphones to have a physical t9 numeric keypad or qwerty keyboard in either a candybar or sliding form factor some smartphones had resistive touchscreens which allowed for virtual keyboards and handwriting input with a finger or a stylus thus also allowing easy entry of asian characters in 2007 the lg prada was the first mobile phone released with a large capacitive touchscreen later that year apple computer introduced the iphone the iphone was also designed around a large capacitive touchscreen but added support for multitouch gestures for interactions such as pinching to zoom in and out on photos and web pages such phones were notable for abandoning the use of a stylus keyboard or keypad typical for smartphones at the time in favor of a capacitive touchscreen for direct finger input as its only input type the iphone was not a smartphone by conventional terms being that a smartphone is a platform device that allows software to be installed the screen focused hardware of phones centered around a capacitive touchscreen stimulated the software to focus on features such as a web browser designed to render full web pages as opposed to stripped down wap services multimedia functionality such as music and videos and online services such as maps apps the advantages of a design around a capacitive touchscreen affected the development of another smartphone os platform android with a more blackberryesque prototype device scrapped in favor of a touchscreen device with a slideout physical keyboard android and iphone devices popularized the smartphone form factor based on a large capacitive touchscreen and led to the decline of earlier keyboard and keypadfocused platforms microsoft for instance discontinued windows mobile and started a new touchscreenoriented os from scratch called windows phone nokia abandoned symbian and partnered with microsoft to use windows phone on its smartphones windows phone became the thirdmostpopular smartphone os before being replaced by windows 10 mobile which declined in share to become largely irrelevant at less than 05 of the smartphone market palm replaced their palm os with webos which was bought by hewlettpackard and later sold to lg electronics for use on lg smart tvs blackberry limited formerly known as research in motion made a new platform based on qnx blackberry 10 with which it was possible to control a device without having to press any physical buttons this platform was later discontinued by the mid2010s almost all smartphones were touchscreenonly and android and iphone smartphones dominated the market developments in the 2010s the iphone x in 2013 fairphone launched its first socially ethical smartphone at the london design festival to address concerns regarding the sourcing of materials in the manufacturing in october 2013 motorola mobility announced project ara a concept for a modular smartphone platform that would allow users to customize and upgrade their phones with addon modules that attached magnetically to a frame the first smartphone with a fingerprint reader was the motorola atrix 4g in 2011 by 2014 1440p displays began to appear on highend smartphones new trends for smartphone displays began to emerge in 2017 with both lg and samsung releasing flagship smartphones utilizing displays with taller aspect ratios than the common 169 ratio these designs allow the display to have a larger physical size but with a slimmer width than 169 displays with an equivalent screen size future possible developments an example of a flexible display foldable oled smartphones have been anticipated for years but have failed to materialize because of the relatively high failure rate when producing these screens hardware mobile phone features central processing unit smartphones have central processing units cpus similar to those in computers but optimised to operate in low power environments mobile cpu performance depends not only on the clock rate generally given in multiples of hertz but also the memory hierarchy also greatly affects overall performance because of these problems the performance of mobile phone cpus is often more appropriately given by scores derived from various standardized tests to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications display display device a smartphone touchscreen one of the main characteristics of smartphones is the screen depending on the devices design the screen fills most or nearly all of the space on a devices front surface many smartphone displays have an aspect ratio of 169 but taller aspect ratios became more common in 2017 screen sizes are measured in diagonal inches phones with screens larger than 52 inches are often called phablets smartphones with screens over 45 inches in size are commonly difficult to use with only a single hand since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface they may need to be shifted around in the hand held in one hand and manipulated by the other or used in place with both hands due to design advances some modern smartphones with large screen sizes and edgetoedge designs have compact builds that improve their ergonomics while the shift to taller aspect ratios have resulted in phones that have larger screen sizes whilst maintaining the ergonomics associated with smaller 169 displays liquidcrystal displays are the most common others are ips led oled and amoled displays some displays are integrated with pressuresensitive digitizers such as those developed by wacom and samsung and apples 3d touch system sound some audio quality enhancing features such as voice over lte and hd voice have appeared and are often available on newer smartphones sound quality can remain a problem due to the design of the phone the quality of the cellular network and compression algorithms used in long distance calls cellphones have small speakers so that the user can use a speakerphone feature and talk to a person on the phone without holding it to their ear the small speakers can also be used to listen to digital audio files of music or speech or watch videos with an audio component without holding the phone close to the ear battery a highcapacity portable battery charger by the end of 2017 smartphone battery life has become generally adequate smartphone users purchase additional chargers for use outside the home at work and in cars and by buying portable external battery packs external battery packs include generic models which are connected to the smartphone with a cable and custommade models that piggyback onto a smartphones case in 2016 samsung had to recall millions of the galaxy note 7 smartphones due to an explosive battery issue accessories a wide range of accessories are sold for smartphones including cases screen protectors power charging cables wireless power stations usb onthego adapters for connecting usb drives and or in some cases a hdmi cable to an external monitor addon batteries headphones combined headphonemicrophones which for example allow a person to privately conduct calls on the device without holding it to the ear and bluetoothenabled powered speakers that enable users to listen to media from their smartphones wirelessly cases range from relatively inexpensive rubber or soft plastic cases which provide moderate protection from bumps and good protection from scratches to more expensive heavyduty cases that combine a rubber padding with a hard outer shell some cases have a booklike form with a cover that the user opens to use the device when the cover is closed it protects the screen some booklike cases have additional pockets for credit cards thus enabling people to use them as wallets accessories include products sold by the manufacturer of the smartphone and compatible products made by other manufacturers software mobile

or operating other phone featuresis common but controversial since it is widely considered dangerous due to what is known as distracted driving being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of accidents in september 2010 the us national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa reported that 995 people were killed by drivers distracted by phones in march 2011 a us insurance company state farm insurance announced the results of a study which showed 19 of drivers surveyed accessed the internet on a smartphone while driving many jurisdictions prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving in egypt israel japan portugal and singapore both handheld and handsfree calling on a mobile phone which uses a speakerphone is banned in other countries including the uk and france and in many us states only the use of calling on handheld phones is banned while handsfree use is permitted a 2011 study reported that over 90 of college students surveyed text initiate reply or read while driving the scientific literature on the danger of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone or texting while driving is limited a simulation study at the university of utah found a sixfold increase in distractionrelated accidents when texting due to the complexity of smartphones that began to grow more after this has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials when attempting to distinguish one usage from another in drivers using their devices this is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and handsfree usage rather than those which ban handheld use only as officials cannot easily tell which function of the phone is being used simply by looking at the driver this can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally for a call when in fact they were using the device legally for example when using the phones incorporated controls for car stereo gps or satnav a sign along bellaire boulevard in southside place texas greater houston states that using mobile phones while driving is prohibited from 730 am to 930 am and from 200 pm to 415 pm a 2010 study reviewed the incidence of phone use while cycling and its effects on behavior and safety accidents involving a driver being distracted by being in a call on a phone have begun to be prosecuted as negligence similar to speeding in the united kingdom from 27 february 2007 motorists who are caught using a handheld phone while driving will have three penalty points added to their license in addition to the fine of 60 public

a patent war between samsung and apple started when the latter claimed that the original galaxy s android phone copied the interfaceand possibly the hardwareof apples ios for the iphone 3gs there was also smartphone patents licensing and litigation involving sony mobile google apple inc samsung microsoft nokia motorola htc huawei and zte among others the conflict is part of the wider patent wars between multinational technology and software corporations to secure and increase market share companies granted a patent can sue to prevent competitors from using the methods the patent covers since the 2010s the number of lawsuits countersuits and trade complaints based on patents and designs in the market for smartphones and devices based on smartphone oses such as android and ios has increased

company was purchased by realnetworks and folded into their gamehouse division games the games on the zylom website are divided into online games and downloadable games the online versions of the game are only trials with various restrictions for the player such as shortened time period or levels heshe can play unless heshe purchases the full game although zylomcom is not a free gaming site it still uses thirdparty ads for its online trial games the advertising consist of not only regular images and flash animations but also constant ingame ads these ads pause the trial of the game for an amount of time while displaying themselves and the player is forced to wait until the ad finishes before returning to the game this form of advertising during gameplay can easily irritate some players and spoil their gaming experience the downloadable versions of games are called deluxe games these games are not for free but only available through direct payment to the site or by having a paid subscription plan a player can still download and use a trial of a game in which they can only play the game for 30 minutes as in many vendors offers the way this site presents its downloadable trials may be confusing for some people meaning that the player can be fooled that they are about to actually download a full unrestricted game for free zylom claims to release new online and download games every week most of the games offered by zylom are according to them fully localized in 8 languages english french spanish german dutch swedish italian and portuguese the main casual game categories offered are 3inarow games action games board games bubble games card games hidden object games management games puzzle games subscriptions zylom offers two paid subscription models called funpass and funticket funpass is a paid subscription which allows players to download and play all deluxe games with no restrictions in principle it works like a library card players can borrow as many games as they would like during their paid subscription period but do not purchase any individual games at the end of 2013 zylom introduced a new paid subscription type funticket this paid subscription allows players to own for free one full game each month that in contrary to funpass they can keep it forever and a 30 discount on any other game purchase both paid subscriptions use an automatic renewal at the end of the subscription period that means that the player has to manually cancel the paid subscription right before its end otherwise they will be charged an additional subscription period which will be automatically applied afterwards although the site typically informs the user for this subscription behaviour it can be very easy for himher to not notice it and be charged additionally without hisher will history zylom was founded in eindhoven the netherlands in 2001 due to the success of the company it expanded fast and just a couple of years later in 2006 it was acquired by the american realnetworks inc in 2011 realnetworks came up with one name for all their game websites gamehouse zylom became part of gamehouse too but because of the popular and wellknown name of the company it stayed zylom for their consumers in 2012 zyloms inhouse game studio was closed but zylom still continues to develop their own game titles like the delicious series the nine founders of zylom had a hard time making the website profitable in the first years releasing deluxe games advertisements and a change of target audience was the answer in the beginning zylom mainly focused on online games for young men until extensive research revealed their games were mostly played by women the company decided to change their target audience and focused more and more on download games that were suitable for female players nowadays zylom is strongly related to wwwgamehousecom wwwrealnetworkscom and wwwatrativacombr 2001 zylom is founded in eindhoven the netherlands 2004 zylom

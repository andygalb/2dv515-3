programmer would create the maps and layouts for a game and a discipline or profession dedicated solely to level design did not exist the first game genre that required significant amounts of time to design areas were textbased games such as muds often promoted users were assigned to create new paths new rooms new equipment and new actions often using the game interface itself 1983s lode runner was one of the first titles to ship with a level editor doom 1993 and doom ii 1994 were two of the first games to attract focused game modding activity and many wad level files were made for them focusing on usergenerated content process the level editor of warzone 2100 level design for each individual level in a modern game typically starts with concept art sketches renderings and physical models once completed these concepts transform into extensive documentation environment modeling and the placing of game specific entities actors usually with the aid of a level editor a level editor may be distributed as a complete standalone package at times rivaling commercial 3d modelling software there are various steps involved in laying out a map and these steps may vary dramatically across the many different game genres that exist today general steps include laying out the largescale features of the map such as hills cities rooms tunnels etc for players and enemies to move around in determining environmental conditions and ground rules such as daynight weather scoring systems allowable weapons or gameplay types time limits and starting resources specifying certain regions where certain gameplay activities or behaviors occur such as resource harvesting base building water travelling etc specifying nonstatic parts of a level such as doors keys and buttons with associated mechanisms teleporters hidden passageways etc specifying locations of various entities such as player units enemies monster spawn points ladders coins resource nodes weapons save points etc specifying the start and exit locations for one or more players adding aesthetic details such as levelspecific graphic textures sounds animation lighting and music introducing scripted event locations where certain actions by the player can trigger specified changes placing pathfinding nodes that nonplayer characters take as they walk around the actions they will take in response to specific triggers and any dialog they might have with the player the first level of the game usually designed to get players to explore the mechanics of the game notably in world 11 of super mario bros cut scenes may be triggered by events in a level but require distinctly different skills and may be created by a different person or team the level design process may be iterated several times before achieving the desired outcome level designers andor concept artists may also be required to provide a prerendered map of the level or entire game world for the player level bugs there are many map bugs that level designers try to avoid but sometimes go unnoticed for some time a player might get stuck in map geometry with no way to escape or to die a player might be able to find a specific spot where they do not have to move to gain experience because monsters are constantly spawned but can be easily and immediately killed in some cases specific mapping tools can be designed to automatically detect problems such as falling outside a level and reaching stuck areas careful level designers run these tools as the last step before releasing a new version of a level in most cases the best way to improve a map is by playtesting it with experienced players and allowing them to try to exploit any problems level designer a level designer is a game designer who creates environments and scenarios using a level editor and other tools although in recent years the responsibility for visual structural and gameplay related tasks has been increasingly divided among several specialists design goals example map editor for the battle for wesnoth level design is necessary for two primary purposes providing players with a goal gameplay alteration maps design can significantly impact the gameplay by extensive use of buttons keys and doors some fps maps may be designed to prevent sniping by not including any long hallways while other maps may allow for a mix of sniping and closer combat gimmick maps are sometimes created to explore selected features of gameplay such as sniping or fist fighting while they are briefly useful to level designers and interesting to experienced players they are usually not included in final list of levels of the game because of their limited replay value player directing levels are generally constructed with flow control in mind that is directing the player towards the goal of the level and preventing confusion and idling this can be accomplished by various means often the level layouts features powerups and items aligned in path and combinations that collecting them inevitably progresses the game and advances the storyline this is one of the basic player direction technique and is most often seen in platformers lighting and illumination as well as distinctly coloured objects are often used to unambiguously steer the player towards the correct path similarly clearly marked chokepoints can be introduced another method is strategic placement of obstacles and aesthetic environment props that direct the players attention to clear paths instead this is often used in closed stuffed environments levels may be designed to force the players to explore the map and advance most rts maps give each player a starting base but will have resource distribution and terrain features designed to draw players out of their base and engage each other teamplay maps can provide noticeable advantages to one team over another when designed poorly hidden features level designers sometimes create hidden rooms and areas that usually require more effort for the player to reach or to notice for example quake has many secret areas that reward the player with ammo weapons quad damage powerups and in one hardtoreach secret area dopefish makes an appearance in fact the hardest difficulty level titled nightmare is only reachable through a secret portal in the fourth dimensions entrance hall sometimes a whole level may be designed as a secret level tools list of level editors a wide variety of tools may be used by someone designing a level although it is faster to design models and textures with general purpose multimedia creation tools games usually require the data to be in a unique format suited for that games engine for this specific compilers and converters of models textures and audio data may be required to lay out a level sometimes professional 3d editing software such as 3d studio max blender autocad lightwave maya softimage xsi or grome is used usually customized with a special plugin developed for the specific game

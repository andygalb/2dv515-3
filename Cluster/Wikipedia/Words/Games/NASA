independent agency of the united states federal government responsible for the civilian space program as well as aeronautics and aerospace research nasa was established in 1958 succeeding the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca the new agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science since its establishment most us space exploration efforts have been led by nasa including the apollo moon landing missions the skylab space station and later the space shuttle nasa is supporting the international space station and is overseeing the development of the orion multipurpose crew vehicle the space launch system and commercial crew vehicles the agency is also responsible for the launch services program which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned nasa launches nasa science is focused on better understanding earth through the earth observing system creation creation of nasa

necessity that this challenge while this new federal agency would conduct all nonmilitary space activity the advanced research projects agency arpa was created in february 1958 to develop space technology for military application on july 29 1958 eisenhower signed the national aeronautics and space act establishing nasa when it began operations on october 1 1958 nasa absorbed the 43yearold naca intact its 8000 employees an annual budget of us100million three major research laboratories langley aeronautical laboratory ames aeronautical laboratory and lewis flight propulsion laboratory and two small test facilities staff and leadership list of nasa administrators jim bridenstine speaks to three astronauts aboard the international space station shortly after being sworn in as nasas thirteenth administrator the agencys leader nasas administrator is nominated by the president of the united states subject to approval of the us senate and reports to him or her and serves as senior space science advisor though space exploration is ostensibly nonpartisan the appointee usually is associated with the presidents political party democratic or republican and a new administrator is usually chosen when the presidency changes parties the only exceptions to this have been democrat thomas o paine acting administrator under democrat lyndon b johnson stayed on while republican richard nixon tried but failed to get one of his own choices to accept the job paine was confirmed by the senate in march 1969 and served through september 1970 republican james c fletcher appointed by nixon and confirmed in april 1971 stayed through may 1977 into the term of democrat jimmy carter daniel goldin was appointed by republican george h w bush and stayed through the entire administration of democrat bill clinton robert m lightfoot jr associate administrator under democrat barack obama was kept on as acting administrator by republican donald trump until trumps own choice jim bridenstine was confirmed in april 2018 the first administrator was dr t keith glennan appointed by republican president dwight d eisenhower during his term he brought together the disparate projects in american space development research the second administrator james e webb 19611968 appointed by president john f kennedy was a democrat who first publicly served under president harry s truman in order to implement the apollo program to achieve kennedys moon landing goal by the end of the 1960s webb directed major management restructuring and facility expansion establishing the houston manned spacecraft johnson center and the florida launch operations kennedy center capitalizing on kennedys legacy president lyndon johnson kept continuity with the apollo program by keeping webb on when he succeeded kennedy in november 1963 but webb resigned in october 1968 before apollo achieved its goal and republican president richard m nixon replaced webb with republican thomas o paine organizational structure of nasa 2015 james fletcher was responsible for early planning of the space shuttle program during his first term as administrator under president nixon he was appointed for a second term as administrator from may 1986 through april 1989 by president ronald reagan to help the agency recover from the space shuttle challenger disaster former astronaut charles bolden served as nasas twelfth administrator from july 2009 to january 20 2017 bolden is one of three former astronauts who became nasa administrators along with richard h truly served 19891992 and frederick d gregory

the may 28 1964 saturn i sa6 launch wernher von braun is at center nasa has conducted many manned and unmanned spaceflight programs throughout its history unmanned programs launched the first american artificial satellites into earth orbit for scientific and communications purposes and sent scientific probes to explore the planets of the solar system starting with venus and mars and including grand tours of the outer planets manned programs sent the first americans into low earth orbit leo won the space race with the soviet union by landing twelve men on the moon from 1969 to 1972 in the apollo program developed a semireusable leo space shuttle and developed leo space station capability by itself and with the cooperation of several other nations including postsoviet russia some missions include both manned and unmanned aspects such as the galileo probe which was deployed by astronauts in earth orbit before being sent unmanned to jupiter manned programs some of nasas first africanamerican astronauts including dr ronald mcnair guy bluford and fred gregory from the class of 1978 selection of astronauts the experimental rocketpowered aircraft programs started by naca were extended by nasa as support for manned spaceflight this was followed by a oneman space capsule program and in turn by a twoman capsule program reacting to loss of national prestige and security fears caused by early leads in space exploration by the soviet union in 1961 president john f kennedy proposed the ambitious goal of landing a man on the moon by the end of x15 rocket plane 19591968 north american x15 x15 in powered flight the x15 was an naca experimental rocketpowered hypersonic research aircraft developed in conjunction with the us air force and navy the design featured a slender fuselage with fairings along the side containing fuel and early computerized control systems requests for proposal were issued on december 30 1954 for the airframe and february 4 1955 for the rocket engine the airframe contract was awarded to north american aviation in november 1955 and the xlr30 engine contract was awarded to reaction motors in 1956 and three planes were built the x15 was droplaunched from the wing of one of two nasa boeing b52 stratofortresses nb52a tail number 52003 and nb52b tail number 52008 known as the balls 8 release took place at an altitude of about 45000 feet 14km and a speed of about 500 miles per hour 805kmh twelve pilots were selected for the program from the air force navy and naca later nasa a total of 199 flights were made between 1959 and 1968 resulting in the official world record for the highest speed ever reached by a manned powered aircraft current as of 2014 project mercury 19581963 project mercury john glenn on friendship 7 first us orbital flight 1962 shortly after the space race began an early objective was to get a person into earth orbit as soon as possible therefore the simplest spacecraft that could be launched by existing rockets was favored the us air forces man in space soonest program considered many manned spacecraft designs ranging from rocket planes like the x15 to small ballistic space capsules when nasa was created that same year the air force program was transferred to it and renamed project mercury the first seven astronauts were selected among candidates from the navy air force and marine test pilot programs on may 5 1961 astronaut alan shepard became the first american in space aboard freedom7 launched by a redstone booster on a 15minute ballistic suborbital flight the soviet union ussr competed with its own singlepilot spacecraft vostok they sent the first man in space by launching cosmonaut yuri gagarin into a single earth orbit aboard vostok 1 in april 1961 one month before shepards flight in august 1962 they achieved an almost fourday record flight with andriyan nikolayev aboard vostok 3 and also conducted a concurrent vostok 4 mission carrying pavel popovich project gemini 19611966 project gemini ed white on gemini 4 first us spacewalk 1965 based on studies to grow the mercury spacecraft capabilities to longduration flights developing space rendezvous techniques and precision earth landing project gemini was started as a twoman program in 1962 to overcome the soviets lead and to support the apollo manned lunar landing program adding extravehicular activity eva and rendezvous and docking to its objectives the first manned gemini flight gemini 3 was flown by gus grissom and john young on march 23 1965 under the direction of soviet premier nikita khrushchev the ussr competed with gemini by converting their vostok spacecraft into a two or threeman voskhod they succeeded in launching two manned flights before geminis first flight achieving a threecosmonaut flight in 1963 and the first eva in 1964 after this the program was canceled and gemini caught up while spacecraft designer sergei korolev developed the soyuz spacecraft their answer to apollo apollo program 19611972 apollo program apollo 11 buzz aldrin on the moon 1969 the us publics perception of the soviet lead in the space race by putting the first man into space motivated president john f kennedy to ask the congress on may 25 1961 to commit the federal government to a program to land a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s which effectively launched the apollo program apollo was one of the most expensive american scientific programs ever it cost more than 20 billion in 1960s dollars the second manned mission apollo 8 brought astronauts for the first time in a flight around the moon in december 1968 apollo 17 lrv003 1972 the first person to stand on the moon was neil armstrong who was followed by buzz aldrin while michael collins orbited above five subsequent apollo missions also landed astronauts on the moon the last in december 1972 throughout these six apollo spaceflights twelve men walked on the moon these missions returned a wealth of scientific data and 3817 kilograms 842lb of lunar samples topics covered by experiments performed included soil mechanics meteoroids seismology heat flow lunar ranging magnetic fields and solar wind apollo set major milestones in human spaceflight it stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low earth orbit and landing humans on another celestial body apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body while apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low earth orbit to date the program spurred advances in many areas of technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight including avionics telecommunications and computers apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world notably at the smithsonians air and space museums skylab 19651979 skylab skylab in 1974 seen from the departing skylab 4 csm skylab was the united states first and only independently built space station to save cost nasa used one of the saturn v rockets originally earmarked for a canceled apollo mission to launch the skylab apollo spacecraft were used for transporting astronauts to and from the station three threeman crews stayed aboard the station for periods of 28 59 and 84 days skylabs habitable volume was 11290 cubic feet 320m3 which was 307 times bigger than that of the apollo command module apollosoyuz test project 19721975 apollosoyuz test project soviet and american crews with spacecraft model 1975 on may 24 1972 us president richard m nixon and soviet premier alexei kosygin signed an agreement calling for a joint manned space mission and declaring intent for all future international manned spacecraft to be capable of docking with each other the mission included both joint and separate scientific experiments and provided useful engineering experience for future joint usrussian space flights such as the shuttlemir program and the international space station space shuttle program 19722011 space shuttle program launch of a space shuttle mae jemison working in spacelab in 1992 spacelab was a major nasa collaboration with europes space agencies the space shuttle became the major focus of nasa in the late 1970s and the 1980s planned as a frequently launchable and mostly reusable vehicle four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985 the first to launch columbia did so on april 12 1981 its major components were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solidfuel launch rockets at its side the external tank which was bigger than the spacecraft itself was the only major component that was not reused the shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185643km 115400 miles on 20 missions 198398 the space shuttle carried spacelab designed in cooperation with the european space agency esa spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight but remained in the shuttles cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock in 1995 russianamerican interaction resumed with the shuttlemir missions 19951998 once more an american vehicle docked with a russian craft this time a fullfledged space station this cooperation has continued with russia and the united states as two of the biggest partners in the largest space station built the international space station iss the strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when nasa began relying on russian launch vehicles to service the iss during the twoyear grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 space shuttle columbia disaster the shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters challenger

respectively jwst main mirror assembled november 2016 more than 1000 unmanned missions have been designed to explore the earth and the solar system the missions have been launched directly from earth or from orbiting space shuttles which could either deploy the satellite itself or with a rocket stage to take it farther the first us unmanned satellite was explorer 1 which started as an abmajpl project during the early part of the space race it was launched in january 1958 two months after sputnik at the creation of nasa the explorer project was transferred to the agency and still continues to this day its missions have been focusing on the earth and the sun measuring magnetic fields and the solar wind among other aspects the inner solar system has been made the goal of at least four unmanned programs the first was mariner in the 1960s and 70s which made multiple visits to venus and mars and one to mercury probes launched under the mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby mariner 2 to take the first pictures from another planet mariner 4 the first planetary orbiter mariner 9 and the first to make a gravity assist maneuver mariner 10 this is a technique where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination the first successful landing on mars was made by viking 1 in 1976 twenty years later a rover was landed on mars by mars pathfinder outside mars jupiter was first visited by pioneer 10 in 1973 more than 20 years later galileo sent a probe into the planets atmosphere and became the first spacecraft to orbit the planet pioneers 10 and 11 and both voyager probes carry messages from the earth to extraterrestrial life on november 26 2011 nasas mars science laboratory mission was successfully

directed nasa to form an aerospace safety advisory panel asap to advise the nasa administrator on safety issues and hazards in nasas aerospace programs in the aftermath of the shuttle columbia accident congress required that the asap submit an annual report to the nasa administrator and to congress the national aeronautics and space administration authorization act of 2014 reaffirmed the importance of asap directives further information space policy of the united states artistic rendition of space station freedom with the orbiter vehicle some of the major nasa directives were to land people on the moon build the space shuttle and build a large space station typically the major directives had the intervention of the science advisory political funding and public interest that synergized into various waves of effort often heavily swayed by technical funding and worldwide events for example there was a major push to build space station freedom in the 1980s but when the cold war ended the russians the americans and other international partners came together to build the international space station in the 2010s the major shift was the retirement of the space shuttle and the development of a new manned heavy lift rocket the space launch system missions for the new system have varied but overall they were similar as it primarily involved the desire to send a human into the space the space exploration initiative of the 1980s opened newer avenues of galaxy exploration in the coming decades the focus is gradually shifting towards exploration of planet mars however some differences exist over the technologies to develop and focus on for the exploration longer project execution timelines means its up to the future officials to execute on a directive which often leads to directional mismanagement for example a shuttle replacement has numerous components involved each making some headway before being called off for various reasons including the national aerospace plane venture star orbital space plane ares i and others the asteroid mission was not a major directive in the 2010s instead the general support rested with the long term goal of getting humans to mars the space shuttle was retired and much of the existing road map was shelved including the then planned lunar return and ares i human launch vehicle previously in the early 2000s there was a plan called the constellation program but this was defunded in the early 2010s nasa authorization act of 2017 orion at iss artwork the nasa authorization act of 2017 which included 195 billion in funding for that fiscal year directed nasa to get humans near or on the surface of mars by the early 2030s space policy directive 1 in december 2017 on the 45th anniversary of the last manned mission to the lunar surface president donald trump approved a directive that includes a lunar mission on the pathway to mars and beyond well learn the directive im signing today will refocus americas space program on human exploration and discovery it marks an important step in returning american astronauts to the moon for the first time since 1972 for longterm exploration and use this time we will not only plant our flag and leave our footprint we will establish a foundation for an eventual mission to mars and perhaps someday to many worlds beyondpresident trump 2017 new nasa administrator jim bridenstine addressed this directive in an august 2018 speech where he focused on the sustainability aspectsgoing to the moon to staythat are explicit in the directive including taking advantage of us commercial space capability that did not exist even five years ago which have driven down costs and increased access to space research nasa research for technologies funded or otherwise supported by nasa see nasa spinoff technologies nasa developed this hardsuit in the 1980s at the ames research center nasas aeronautics research mission directorate conducts aeronautics research nasa has made use of technologies such as the multimission radioisotope thermoelectric generator mmrtg which is a type of radioisotope thermoelectric generator used on space missions the earth science research program was created and first funded in the 1980s under the administrations of ronald reagan and george hw bush nasa started an annual competition in 2014 named cubes in space climate study nasa also researches and publishes on climate change facilities jet propulsion laboratory complex in pasadena californiavehicle assembly and launch control at kennedy space center nasa facilities nasas facilities are research construction and communication centers to help its missions some facilities serve more than one application for historic or administrative reasons nasa also operates a shortline railroad at the kennedy space center and uses special aircraft john f kennedy space center ksc is one of the bestknown nasa facilities it has been the launch site for every united states

budget nasas budget from 1958 to 2012 as a percentage of federal budget an artists conception from nasa of an astronaut planting a us flag on mars a manned mission to mars has been discussed as a possible nasa mission since the 1960s budget of nasa nasas share of the total federal budget peaked at approximately 441 in 1966 during the apollo program then rapidly declined to approximately 1 in 1975 and stayed around that level through 1998 despite this public perception of nasas budget differs significantly a 1997 poll indicated that most americans believed that 20 of the federal budget went to nasa for fiscal year 2015 nasa received an appropriation of us1801 billion from congress549 million more than requested and approximately 350 million more than the 2014 nasa budget passed by congress in fiscal year 2016 nasa received 193 billion president donald trump signed the nasa transition authorization act of 2017 in march which set the 2017 budget at around 195 billion examples of

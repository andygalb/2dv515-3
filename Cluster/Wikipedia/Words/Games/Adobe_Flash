development platform adobe air continues to be supported artists may produce flash graphics and animations using adobe animate software developers may produce applications and video games using adobe flash builder flashdevelop flash catalyst or any text editor when used with the apache flex sdk endusers can view flash content via flash player for web browsers air for desktop or mobile apps or thirdparty players such as scaleform for video games adobe flash player supported on microsoft windows macos and linux enables endusers to view flash content using web browsers adobe flash lite enabled viewing flash content on older smartphones but has been discontinued and superseded by adobe air the actionscript programming language allows the development of interactive animations video

although flash was previously a dominant platform for online multimedia content it is slowly being abandoned as adobe favors a transition to html5 flash player has been deprecated and has an official endoflife by 2020 applications websites in the early 2000s flash was widely installed on desktop computers and was commonly used to display interactive web pages online games and to playback video and audio content between 2000 and 2010 numerous businesses used flashbased websites to launch new products or to create interactive company portals in 2007 youtube offered videos in html5 format to support the iphone and ipad which did not support flash player rias after flash 5 introduced actionscript in 2000 developers combined the visual and programming capabilities of flash to produce interactive experiences and applications for the web in 2004 macromedia flex was released and specifically targeted the application development market between 2006 and 2016 the speedtestnet web service conducted over 90 billion speed tests using an ria built with adobe flash as of 2016 web applications and rias can be developed with flash using the actionscript 30 programming language and related tools such as adobe flash builder thirdparty ides such as flashdevelop and powerflasher fdt also enable developers to create flash games and applications and are generally similar to microsoft

desktop or mobile platforms adobe scout to improve performance crossbridge to convert cbased games to run in flash and stage3d to support gpuaccelerated video games 3d frameworks like away3d and flare3d simplified creation of 3d content for flash adobe air allows creation of flashbased mobile games which may be published to the google play and apple app stores flash is also used to build interfaces and huds for 3d video games using scaleform gfx a technology that renders flash content within nonflash video games scaleform is supported by more than 10 major video game engines including unreal engine udk cryengine and phyreengine and has been used to provide 3d interfaces for more than 150 major video game titles since its launch in 2003 film and animation list of flash animated films and list of flash animated television series adobe animate is one of the common animation programs for lowcost 2d television and commercial animation in competition with anime studio and toon boom animation notable users of flash include dhx media vancouver for productions including pound puppies and my little pony friendship is magic fresh tv for total drama nelvana for 6teen and clone high williams street for metalocalypse and squidbillies nickelodeon animation studios for wow wow wubbzy el tigre the adventures of manny rivera danny phantom and more flash is less commonly used for featurelength animated films however 2009s the secret of kells an irish film was animated primarily in adobe flash and was nominated for an academy award for best animated feature at the 82nd academy awards several popular online series are currently produced in flash such as the emmy awardwinning offmikes produced by espn and animax entertainment happy tree friends gotham girls produced by warner brothers crime time produced by future thought productions and homestar runner produced by mike and matt chapman various thirdparty software packages designed for traditionally trained cartoonists and animators can publish animations in the swf format history futurewave the precursor to flash was a product named smartsketch published by futurewave software the company was founded by charlie jackson jonathan gay and michelle welsh as the internet became more popular futurewave realized the potential for a vectorbased web animation tool that might challenge macromedia shockwave technology futurewave approached adobe systems with an offer to sell them futuresplash in 1995 but adobe turned down the offer at that time macromedia in november 1996 futuresplash was acquired by macromedia and macromedia rebranded and released futuresplash animator as macromedia flash 10 flash was a twopart system a graphics and animation editor known as macromedia flash and a player known as macromedia flash player futuresplash animator was an animation tool originally developed for penbased computing devices due to the small size of the futuresplash viewer it was particularly suited for download on the web macromedia distributed flash player as a free browser plugin in order to quickly gain market share by 2005 more computers worldwide had flash player installed than any other web media format including java quicktime realnetworks and windows media player macromedia upgraded the flash system between 1996 and 1999 adding movieclips actions the precursor to actionscript alpha transparency and other features as flash matured macromedias focus shifted from marketing it as a graphics and media tool to promoting it as a web application platform adding scripting and data access capabilities to the player while attempting to retain its small footprint in 2000 the first major version of actionscript was developed and released with flash 5 actionscript 20 was released with flash mx 2004 and supported objectoriented programming improved ui components and other programming features the last version of flash released by macromedia was flash 8 which focused on graphical upgrades such as filters blur drop shadow etc blend modes similar to adobe photoshop and advanced features for flv video adobe macromedia was acquired by adobe systems in 2005 and the entire macromedia product line including flash dreamweaver directorshockwave fireworks which has since been discontinued and authorware is now handled by adobe in 2007 adobes first version release was adobe flash cs3 professional the ninth major version of flash it introduced the actionscript 30 programming language which supported modern programming practices and enabled business applications to be developed with flash adobe flex builder built on eclipse targeted the enterprise application development market and was also released the same year flex builder included the flex sdk a set of components that included charting advanced ui and data services flex data services in 2008 adobe released the tenth version of flash adobe flash cs4 flash 10 improved animation capabilities within the flash editor adding a motion editor panel similar to adobe after effects inverse kinematics bones basic 3d object animation objectbased animation and other text and graphics features flash player 10 included an inbuilt 3d engine without gpu acceleration that allowed basic object transformations in 3d space position rotation scaling also in 2008 adobe released the first version of adobe integrated runtime later rebranded as adobe air a runtime engine that replaced flash player and provided additional capabilities to the actionscript 30 language to build desktop and mobile applications with air developers could access the file system the users files and folders and connected devices such as joystick gamepad and sensors for the first time in 2011 adobe flash player 11 was released and with it the first version of stage3d allowing gpuaccelerated 3d rendering for flash applications and games on desktop platforms such as microsoft windows and mac os x adobe air was upgraded to support 64bit computers and to allow developers to add additional functionality to the air runtime using air native extensions ane in 2014 adobe air reached a milestone with over 100000 unique applications built and over 1 billion installations logged across the world may 2014 open screen project on may 1 2008 adobe announced the open screen project with the intent of providing a consistent application interface across devices such as personal computers mobile devices and consumer electronics as of february 2009 with amf available as an open source implementation blazeds the list of mobile device providers who have joined the project includes palm motorola and nokia end of life although flash was previously a dominant platform for online multimedia content it is slowly being abandoned as adobe favors a transition to html5 due to inherent security flaws and significant resources required to maintain the platform apple restricted the use of flash on ios in 2010 due to concerns that it performed poorly on its mobile devices had negative impact on battery life and was deemed unnecessary for online content the flash platform will continue in the form of adobe air which adobe will continue to develop and openfl a multitarget opensource implementation of the flash api format fla flash source files are in the fla format and contain graphics and animation as well as embedded assets such as bitmap images audio files and flv video files the flash source file format is a proprietary format and adobe animate is the only available authoring tool capable of editing such files flash source files fla may be compiled into flash movie files swf using adobe animate note that fla files can be edited but output swf files cannot swf swf flash movie files are in the swf format traditionally called shockwave flash movies flash movies or flash applications usually have a swf file extension and may be used in the form of a web page plugin strictly played in a standalone flash player or incorporated into a selfexecuting projector movie with the exe extension in microsoft windows flash video files have a flv file extension and are either used from within swf files or played through a flvaware player such as vlc or quicktime and windows media player with external codecs added the use of vector graphics combined with program code allows flash files to be smallerand thus allows streams to use less bandwidththan the corresponding bitmaps or video clips for content in a single format such as just text video or audio other alternatives may provide better performance and consume less cpu power than the corresponding flash movie for example when using transparency or making large screen updates such as photographic or text fades in addition to a vectorrendering engine the flash player includes a virtual machine called the actionscript virtual machine avm for scripting interactivity at runtime with video mp3based audio and bitmap graphics as of flash player 8 it offers two video codecs on2 technologies vp6 and sorenson spark and runtime jpeg progressive jpeg png and gif capability 3d stage3d flash player 11 introduced a full 3d shader api called stage3d which is fairly similar to webgl stage3d enables gpuaccelerated rendering of 3d graphics within flash games and applications and has been used to build angry birds and a couple of other notable games various 3d frameworks have been built for flash using stage3d such as away3d 4 and unity also export flash versions which use stage3d to render 3d graphics flash video flash video virtually all browser plugins for video are free of charge and crossplatform including adobes offering of flash video which was introduced with flash version 6 flash video has been a popular choice for websites due to the large installed user base and programmability of flash in 2010 apple publicly criticized adobe flash including its implementation of video playback for not taking advantage of hardware acceleration one reason flash is not to be found on apples mobile devices soon after apples criticism adobe demoed and released a beta version of flash 101 which uses available gpu hardware acceleration even on a mac flash 102 beta released december 2010 adds hardware acceleration for the whole video rendering pipeline flash player supports two distinct modes of video playback and hardware accelerated video decoding may not be used for older video content such content causes excessive cpu usage compared to comparable content played with other players software rendered video flash player supports software rendered video since version 6 such video supports vector animations displayed above the video content this obligation may depending on graphic apis exposed by the operating system prohibit using a video overlay like a traditional multimedia player would use with the consequence that color space conversion and scaling must happen in software hardware accelerated video flash player supports hardware accelerated video playback since version 102 for h264 f4v and flv video formats such video is displayed above all flash content and takes advantage of video codec chipsets installed on the users device developers must specifically use the stagevideo technology within flash player in order for hardware decoding to be enabled flash player internally uses technologies such as directx video acceleration and opengl to do so in tests done by ars technica in 2008 and 2009 adobe flash player performed better on windows than mac os x and linux with the same hardware performance has later improved for the latter two on mac os x with flash player 101 flash audio flash audio is most commonly encoded in mp3 or aac advanced audio coding however it can also use adpcm nellymoser nellymoser asao codec and speex audio codecs flash allows sample rates of 11 22 and 441khz it cannot have 48khz audio sample rate which is the standard tv and dvd sample rate on august 20 2007 adobe announced on its blog that with update 3 of flash player 9 flash video will also implement some parts of the mpeg4 international standards adobe flash player 101 does not have acoustic echo cancellation unlike the voip offerings of skype and google voice making this and earlier versions of flash less suitable for group calling or meetings flash player 103 beta incorporates acoustic echo cancellation scripting language further information actionscript actionscript is the programming language used by flash it is an enhanced superset of the ecmascript programming language with a classical javastyle class model rather than javascripts prototype model specifications in october 1998 macromedia disclosed the flash version 3 specification on its website it did this in response to many new and often semiopen formats competing with swf such as xaras flare and sharps extended vector animation formats several developers quickly created a c library for producing swf in february 1999 morphink 99 was introduced the first thirdparty program to create swf files macromedia also hired middlesoft to create a freely available developers kit for the swf file format versions 3 to 5 macromedia made the flash files specifications for versions 6 and later available only under a nondisclosure agreement but they are widely available from various sites in april 2006 the flash swf file format specification was released with details on the then newest version format flash 8 although still lacking specific information on the incorporated video compression formats on2 sorenson spark etc this new documentation covered all the new features offered in flash v8 including new actionscript commands expressive filter controls and so on the file format specification document is offered only to developers who agree to a license agreement that permits them to use the specifications only to develop programs that can export to the flash file format the license does not allow the use of the specifications to create programs that can be used for playback of flash files the flash 9 specification was made available under similar restrictions in june 2009 adobe launched the open screen project adobe link which made the swf specification available without restrictions previously developers could not use the specification for making swfcompatible players but only for making swfexporting authoring software the specification still omits information on codecs such as sorenson spark however animation tools official tools adobe animate the adobe animate authoring program is primarily used to design graphics and animation and publish the same for websites web applications and video games the program also offers limited support for audio and video embedding and actionscript scripting adobe released adobe livemotion designed to create interactive animation content and export it to a variety of formats including swf livemotion failed to gain any notable user base in february 2003 macromedia purchased presedia which had developed a flash authoring tool that automatically converted powerpoint files into flash macromedia subsequently released the new product as breeze which included many new enhancements thirdparty tools comparison of vector graphics editors various free and commercial software packages can output animations into the flash swf format suitable for display on the web including swish max is an animation editor with preset animation developed by an exemployee of macromedia that can output flash animations toon boom is a traditional animation tool that can output

4 linux project was an initiative to develop an open source linux application as an alternative to adobe animate development plans included authoring capacity for 2d animation and tweening as well as outputing swf file formats f4l evolved into an editor that was capable of authoring 2d animation and publishing of swf files flash 4 linux was renamed uira uira intended to combine the resources and knowledge of the f4l project and the qflash project both of which were open source applications that aimed to provide an alternative to the proprietary adobe flash programming tools official tools adobe provides a series of tools to develop software applications and video games for flash apache flex sdk a free open source sdk to compile flashbased rich internet applications from source code the apache flex actionscript 30 compiler generates swf files from actionscript 3 files flex was the primary actionscript 3 compiler and was actively developed by adobe before it was donated to apache

aggressively contribute to html5 there is no adobe flash player for ios devices iphone ipad and ipod touch however flash content can be made to run on ios devices in a variety of ways flash content can be bundled inside an adobe air app which will then run on ios devices apple did not allow this for a while but they relaxed those restrictions in september 2010 on march 8 2011 techradar reported that adobe provides an experimental server side tool wallaby to convert flash programs as far as possible to html5 code thus allowing ios devices to display the content if the content is flash video being served by adobe flash media server 45 the server will translate and send the video as http dynamic streaming or http live streaming both of which can be played by ios devices some specialized

iphone ipad the only alternative is using html5 and responsive web design to build websites that support both desktop and mobile devices however flash is still used to build mobile games using adobe air such games will not work in mobile web browsers but must be installed via the appropriate app store vendor dependence see also vendor lockin the reliance on adobe for decoding flash makes its use on the world wide web a concernthe completeness of its public specifications are debated and no complete implementation of flash is publicly available in source code form with a license that permits reuse generally public specifications are what makes a format reimplementable see future proofing data storage and reusable codebases can be ported to new platforms without the endorsement of the format creator adobes restrictions on the use of the swfflv specifications were lifted in february 2009 see adobes open screen project however despite efforts of projects like gnash swfdec and lightspark a complete free flash player is yet to be seen as of september 2011 for example gnash cannot use swf v10 yet notable advocates of free software open standards and the world wide web have warned against the use of flash the founder of mozilla europe tristan nitot stated in 2008 companies building websites should beware of proprietary richmedia technologies like adobes flash and microsofts silverlight youre producing content for your users and theres someone in the middle deciding whether users should see your content representing open standards inventor of css and coauthor of html5 hkon wium lie explained in a google tech talk of 2007 entitled the video element the proposal of theora as the format for html5 video i believe very strongly that we need to agree on some kind of baseline video format if is going to succeed flash is today the baseline format on the web the problem with flash is that its not an open standard representing the free software movement richard stallman stated in a speech in 2004 that the use of flash in websites is a major problem for our community accessibility usability consultant jakob nielsen published an alertbox in 2000 entitled flash 99 bad stating that flash tends to degrade websites for three reasons it encourages design abuse it breaks with the webs fundamental interaction principles and it distracts attention from the sites core value some problems have been at least partially fixed since nielsens complaints text size can be controlled using full page zoom and it has been possible for authors to include alternative text in flash since flash player 6 flash blocking in web browsers some websites rely heavily on flash and become unusable without flash player or with flash blocked flash content is usually embedded using the object or embed html element a web browser that does not fully implement one of these elements displays the replacement text if supplied by the web page often a plugin is required for the browser to fully implement these elements though some users cannot or will not install it since flash can be used to produce content such as advertisements that some users find obnoxious or take a large amount of bandwidth to download some web browsers by default do not play flash content until the user clicks on it eg konqueror kmeleon most current browsers have a feature to block plugins playing one only when the user clicks it opera versions since 105 feature native flash blocking opera turbo requires the user to click to play flash content and the browser also allows the user to enable this option permanently both chrome in june 2015 google announced that chrome will pause advertisements and noncentral flash content by default firefox from version 46

record active moves by third parties to limit the risk began with steve jobs in 2010 saying that apple would not allow flash on the iphone ipod touch and ipad citing abysmal security as one reason as a result adobe has essentially stopped trying to do anything new and innovative with flash flash cookies local shared object like the http cookie a flash cookie also known as a local shared object can be used to save application data flash cookies are not shared across domains an august 2009 study by the ashkan soltani and a team of researchers at uc berkeley found that 50 of websites using flash

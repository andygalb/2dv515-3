pong following space invaders ataris asteroids and namcos pacman further solidified the strength of the golden age other opinions place this periods beginning in the late 1970s when color arcade games

allowed for more complexity than earlier discrete circuitry games such as ataris pong 1972 the arcade boom that began in the late 1970s is credited with establishing the basic techniques of interactive entertainment and for driving down hardware prices to the extent of allowing the pc to become a technological and economic reality while color monitors had been used by several racing video games before such as indy 800 the golden age also saw developers experimenting with vector displays which produced crisp lines that couldnt be duplicated by raster displays a few of these vector games became great hits such as 1979s asteroids 1980s battlezone and tempest and 1983s star wars from atari however vector technology fell out of favor with arcade game companies due to the high cost of repairing vector displays several developers at the time were also experimenting with pseudo3d and stereoscopic 3d using 2d sprites on raster displays in 1979 nintendos radar scope introduced a threedimensional thirdperson perspective to the shoot em up genre later imitated by shooters such as konamis juno first and activisions beamrider in 1983 this period also saw significant advances in

the first laserdisc video game to exploit this technology was 1983s astron belt from sega gameplay with the enormous success of the early games dozens of developers jumped into the development and manufacturing of video arcade games some simply copied the invading alien hordes idea of space invaders and turned out successful imitators like namcos galaxian galaga and gaplus though they took the shoot em up genre further with new gameplay mechanics more complex enemy patterns and richer graphics others tried new concepts and defined new genres rapidly evolving hardware allowed new kinds of games which allowed for different styles of gameplay in 1980 namco released pacman which popularized the maze chase genre and rallyx which featured a radar tracking the player position on the map

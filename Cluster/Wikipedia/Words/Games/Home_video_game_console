consoles and first video game the magnavox odyssey was the first video game console released in 1972 although the first video games appeared in the 1950s in 1972 magnavox released the magnavox odyssey the first home video game console which could be connected to a tv set ralph baers initial design had called for a huge row of switches that would allow gamers to turn on and off certain components of the console the odyssey lacked a cpu to create slightly different games like tennis volleyball hockey and chase magnavox replaced the switch design with separate cartridges for each game although baer had sketched up ideas for cartridges that could include new components for new games the carts released by magnavox all served the same function as the switches and allowed gamers to choose from the odysseys builtin games the odyssey only initially sold about 100000 units making it moderately successful and it was not until ataris arcade game pong popularized video games that the public began to take more notice of the emerging industry by autumn 1975 magnavox bowing to the popularity of pong cancelled the odyssey and released a scaleddown version that played only pong and hockey the odyssey 100 a second higher end console the odyssey 200 was released with the 100 and added onscreen scoring up to four players and a third gamesmash almost simultaneously released with ataris own home pong console through sears these consoles jumpstarted the consumer market all three of the new consoles used simpler designs than the original odyssey with no board game pieces or extra cartridges in the years that followed the market saw many companies rushing similar consoles to market after general instrument released their inexpensive microchips each containing a complete console on a single chip many small developers began releasing consoles that looked different externally but internally were playing exactly the same games most of the consoles from this era were dedicated consoles only playing the games that came with the console these video game consoles were often just called video games because there was little reason to distinguish the two yet while a few companies like atari magnavox and newcomer coleco pushed the envelope the market became flooded with simple similar video games this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations

consoles the atari 2600 became the most popular game console of the second generation fairchild released the fairchild video entertainment system ves in 1976 while there had been previous game consoles that used cartridges either the cartridges had no information and served the same function as flipping switches the odyssey or the console itself was empty coleco telstar and the cartridge contained all of the game components the ves however contained a programmable microprocessor so its cartridges only needed a single rom chip to store microprocessor instructions rca and atari soon released their own cartridgebased consoles the rca studio ii and the atari 2600 originally branded as the atari video computer system respectively both bally with their home library computer in 1977 and magnavox with the odyssey in 1978 also brought their own programmable cartridgebased consoles to the market however it was not until atari released a conversion of the golden age arcade hit space invaders in 1980 for the atari 2600 that the home console industry took off many consumers bought an atari console so they could play space invaders at home space invaders unprecedented success started the trend of console manufacturers trying to get exclusive rights to arcade titles and the trend of advertisements for game consoles claiming to bring the arcade experience home throughout the early 1980s other companies released video game consoles of their own many of the video game systems were technically superior to the atari 2600 and marketed as improvements over the atari 2600 but atari dominated the console market in the early 1980s however a severe crash occurred in 1983 in the video game business this section relies largely or entirely upon a single source relevant

generation see also third generation of video game consoles the nes made video games popular again after the 1983 crash in 1983 nintendo released the family computer or famicom in japan the famicom supported highresolution sprites larger color palettes and tiled backgrounds this allowed famicom games to be longer and have more detailed graphics nintendo began attempts to bring their famicom to the us after the video game market had crashed in the us video games were seen as a fad that had already passed to distinguish its product from older game consoles nintendo released their famicom as the nintendo entertainment system nes which used a frontloading cartridge port similar to a vcr included a plastic robot rob and was initially advertised as a toy the nes was the highest selling console in the history of north america and revitalized the video game market mario of super mario bros became a global icon starting with his nes games nintendo took an unusual stance with thirdparty developers for its console nintendo contractually restricted thirdparty developers to three nes titles per year and forbade them from developing for other video game consoles the practice ensured nintendos market dominance and prevented the flood of trash titles that had helped kill the atari but was ruled illegal late in the consoles life cycle segas master system was intended to compete with the nes but never gained any significant market share in the us or japan and was barely profitable it fared notably better in pal territories in europe and south america the master system competed with the nes and saw new game releases even after segas nextgeneration mega drive was released in brazil where strict importation laws and rampant piracy kept out competitors the master system outsold the nes by a massive margin and remained popular into the 90s jack tramiel after buying atari downsizing its staff and settling its legal disputes attempted to bring atari back into the home console market atari released a smaller sleeker cheaper version of their popular atari 2600 they also released the atari 7800 a console technologically comparable with the nes and backwards compatible with the 2600 finally atari repackaged its 8bit xe home computer as the xegs game console the new consoles helped atari claw its way out of debt but failed to gain much market share from nintendo ataris lack of funds meant that its consoles saw fewer releases lower production values both the manuals and the game labels were frequently black and white and limited distribution japan north america

fourth generation of video game consoles the super famicom the japanese version of the super nes nec brought the first fourthgeneration console to market with their pc engine later sold as the turbografx16 in north america when hudson soft approached them with an advanced graphics chip hudson had previously approached nintendo only to be rebuffed by a company still raking in the profits of the nes the turbografx used the unusual hucard format to store games the small size of these proprietary cards allowed nec to rerelease the console as a handheld game console the pc engine enjoyed brisk sales in japan but its north american counterpart the turbografx lagged behind the competition the console never saw an official release in europe but clones and north american imports were available in some markets starting in 1990 nec advertised their console as 16bit to highlight its advances over the nes this started the trend of all subsequent fourth generations consoles being advertised as 16 bit many people still refer to this generation as the 16bit generation and often refer to the third generation as 8bit sega scaled down and adapted their sega system 16 used to power arcade hits like altered beast and shinobi into the mega drive or genesis and released it with a near arcadeperfect port of altered beast segas console met lukewarm sales in japan but skyrocketed to first place in pal markets and made major inroads in north america propelled by its effective genesis does what nintendont marketing campaign sega capitalized on the genesiss technological superiority over the nes faithful ports of popular arcade games and competitive pricing arcade gaming company snk developed the high end neo geo mvs arcade system which used interchangeable cartridges similar to home consoles building on the success of the mvs snk repackaged the neogeo as the neo geo aes home console though technologically superior to the other fourthgeneration consoles the aes and its games were prohibitively expensive which kept sales low and prevented it from expanding outside its niche market and into serious competition with nintendo and sega the aes did however amass a dedicated cult following allowing it to see new releases into the 2000s the fourth generation graphics chips allowed these consoles to reproduce the art styles that were becoming popular in arcades and on home computers these games often featured lavish background scenery huge characters broader color palettes and increased emphasis on dithering and texture games written specifically for the nes like megaman shatterhand and super mario bros 3 were able to work cleverly within its limitations ports of the increasingly detailed arcade and home computer games came up with various solutions for example when capcom released strider in the arcade they created an entirely separate strider game for the nes that only incorporated themes and characters from the arcade in 1990 nintendo finally brought their super famicom to market and brought it to the us as the super nintendo entertainment system snes a year later its release marginalized the turbografx and the neo geo but came late enough for sega to sell several million consoles in north america and gain a strong foothold the same year the snes was released sega released sonic the hedgehog which spiked genesis sales similar to space invaders on the atari also by 1992 the first fully licensed nfl football game was released nfl sports talk football 93 which was available only on the genesis this impact on genesis sales and the overall interest of realistic sports games would start the trend of licensed sports games being viewed as necessary for the success of a console in the us while nintendo enjoyed dominance in japan and sega in europe the competition between the two was particularly fierce and close in north america ultimately the snes outsold the genesis but only after sega discontinued the genesis to focus on the next generation of consoles one trait that remains peculiar to the fourth generation is the huge number of exclusive games both sega and nintendo were very successful and their consoles developed massive libraries of games both consoles had to be programmed in assembly to get the most out of them a game optimized for the genesis could take advantage of its faster cpu and sound chip a game optimized for the snes could take advantage of its graphics and its flexible clean sound chip some game series like castlevania saw separate system exclusive releases rather than an attempt to port one game to disparate platforms when compact disc cd technology became available midway through the fourth generation each company attempted to integrate it into their existing consoles in different ways nec and sega released cd addons to their consoles in the form of the turbografxcd and sega cd but both were only moderately successful nec also released the turboduo which combined the turbografx16 and the turbografxcd addon along with the ram and bios upgrade from the super system card into one unit snk released a third version of the neogeo the neo geo cd allowing the company to release its games on a cheaper medium than the aess expensive cartridges but it reached the market after nintendo and sega had already sold tens of millions of consoles each nintendo partnered with sony to work on a cd addon for the snes but the deal fell apart when they realized how much control sony wanted sony would use their work with nintendo as the basis for their playstation game console while cds became an increasingly visible part of the market cdreading technology was still expensive in the 90s limiting necs and segas addons sales japan north america europe pc engineturbografx16

game consoles the original playstation became the most popular system of the fifth generation consoles eventually selling over 100 million systems the first fifthgeneration consoles were the 3do and the atari jaguar although both consoles were more powerful than the fourth generation systems neither would become serious threats to sega or nintendo the 3do initially generated a great deal of hype in part because of a licensing scheme where 3do licensed the manufacturing of its console out to third parties similar to vcr or dvd players unfortunately that very structure meant that unlike its competitors who could sell the console at a loss all 3do manufacturers had to sell for profit the cheapest 3do was more expensive than the super nes and genesis combined atari cancelled their line of home computers their atari portfolio the stacy laptop and their handheld atari lynx when they released the jaguar it was an all or nothing gamble that ran the company into the ground the jaguar had three processors and no c libraries to help developers cope with it atari was ineffective at courting third parties and many of their first party games were poorly received while games like tempest 2000 rayman and alien vs predator showed what the console was capable of the vast majority of releases underwhelmed many of the jaguars games used mainly the slowest but most familiar of the consoles processors resulting in titles that could easily have been released on the snes or genesis to compete with emerging next gen consoles nintendo released donkey kong country which could display a wide range of tones something common in fifthgeneration games by limiting the number of hues onscreen and star fox which used an extra chip inside of the cartridge to display polygon graphics sega followed suit releasing vectorman and virtua racing the latter of which used the sega virtua processor sega also released the 32x an addon for the genesis while their sega saturn was still in development and announced that they would replace the genesis with the neptune a combination 32x and genesis and sell it as a budget console alongside their upcoming saturn despite public statements from sega claiming that they would continue to support the genesis32x throughout the next generation sega enterprises quietly killed the neptune project and forced sega of america to abandon the 32x the 32xs brief and confusing existence damaged public perception of the coming saturn and sega as a whole while the fourth generation had seen a handful of acclaimed titles on necs pc engine cdrom and segas mega cd addons it wasnt until the fifth generation that a cdbased consoles and games began to seriously compete with cartridges cds were significantly cheaper to manufacture and distribute than cartridges were and gave developers room to add cinematic cutscenes prerecorded soundtracks and voice acting that made more serious storytelling possible nec had been developing a successor to the pc engine as early as 1990 and presented a prototype dubbed the iron man to developers in 1992 but shelved the project as the pc engine managed to extend the consoles market viability in japan into the mid90s when sales started to dry up nec rushed its old project to the market the pcfx a cdbased 32bit console had highly advanced detailed 2d graphics capabilities and better fullmotion video than any other system on the market it was however incapable of handling 3d graphics forfeiting its chances at seriously competing with sony and sega the console was limited to a niche market of dating sims and visual novels in japan and never saw release in western markets after the abortive 32x sega entered the fifth generation with the saturn sega released several highly regarded titles for the saturn but a series of bad decisions alienated many developers and retailers while the saturn was technologically advanced it was also complex difficult and unintuitive to write games for in particular programming 3d graphics that could compete with those on nintendo and sonys consoles proved exceptionally difficult for thirdparty developers because the saturn used quadrilaterals rather than standard triangles as its basic polygon cross platform games had to be completely rewritten to see a saturn port the saturn was also a victim of internal politics at sega while the saturn sold comparably well in japan segas branches in north america and europe refused to license localization of many popular japanese titles holding they were illsuited to western markets firstparty hits like sakura taisen never saw western releases while several thirdparty titles released on both playstation and saturn in japan like grandia and castlevania symphony of the night were released in north america and europe as playstation exclusives born from a failed attempt to create a console with nintendo sonys playstation would not only dominate its generation but become the first console to sell over 100 million units by expanding the video game market sony actively courted third parties and provided them with convenient c libraries to write their games sony had built the console from the start as a 3d discbased system and emphasized its 3d graphics that would come to be viewed as the future of gaming the playstations cd technology won over several developers who had been releasing titles for nintendo and segas fourth generation consoles such as konami namco capcom and square cds were far cheaper to manufacture and distribute than cartridges were meaning developers could release larger batches of games at higher profit margins nintendos console on the other hand used cartridges unwittingly keeping thirdparty developers away the playstations internal architecture was simpler and more intuitive to program for giving the console an edge over segas saturn nintendo was the last to release a fifth generation console with their nintendo 64 and when they finally released their console it came with only two launch titles partly to curb piracy and partly as a result of nintendos failed disc projects with sony and phillips nintendo used cartridges for their console the higher cost of cartridges drove many third party developers to the playstation the nintendo 64 could handle 3d polygons better than any console released before it but its games often lacked the cutscenes soundtracks and voiceovers that became standard on playstation discs nintendo released several highly acclaimed titles such as super mario 64 and the legend of zelda ocarina of time and the nintendo 64 was able to sell tens of millions of units on the strength of firstparty titles alone but its constant struggles against sony would make the nintendo 64 the last home console to use cartridges as a

generation saw a move towards pclike architectures in gaming consoles as well as a shift towards using dvds for game media this brought games that were both longer and more visually appealing furthermore this generation also saw experimentation with online console gaming and implementing both flash and hard drive storage for game data segas dreamcast was released in japan on november 27 1998 in north america on september 9 1999 in europe on october 14 1999 and in australia on november 30 1999 it was the companys last video game console and was the first of the generations consoles to be discontinued sega implemented a special type of optical media called the gdrom these discs were created in order to prevent software piracy which had been more easily done with consoles of the previous generation however this format was soon cracked as well it also sported a 336kb or 56k modem which could be used to access the internet or play some of the games like phantasy star online online making it the first console with builtin internet connectivity the dreamcast was discontinued in march 2001 and sega transitioned to software developingpublishing only sonys playstation 2 was released in japan on march 4 2000 in north america on october 26 2000 in europe on november 24 2000 and in australia on november 30 2000 it was the followup to its highly successful playstation and was also the first home game console to be able to play dvds as was done with the original playstation in 2000 sony redesigned the console in 2004 into a smaller version as of november 21 2011 over 140 million playstation 2 units have been sold this makes it the best selling home console of all time to date and now the bestselling video game console to date nintendos gamecube was released in

company to use optical media instead of cartridges the nintendo gamecube did not play standard 12cm dvds instead it employed smaller 8cm optical discs with the release of the game boy player all game boy game boy color and game boy advance cartridges could be played on the platform the nintendo gamecube was discontinued in 2007 with the release of wii microsoft released its first games console the

the first to include an ethernet port for broadband internet and the beginning of microsofts online xbox live service microsoft was able to attract many pc developers by using the nt kernel and directx from their windows operating system though criticized for its bulky size and the awkwardness of its original controller the xbox eventually gained popularity especially in the us where it outsold the gamecube to secure second place due in part to the success of the halo franchise japan north america europe dreamcast 1998 1999 playstation 2 2000 nintendo gamecube 2001 2002 xbox 2002

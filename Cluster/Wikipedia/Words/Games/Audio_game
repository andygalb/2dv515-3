electronic game played on a device such as a personal computer it is similar to a video game save that there is audible and tactile feedback but not visual audio games originally started out as blind accessiblegames and were developed mostly by amateurs and blind programmers but more and more people are showing interest in audio games ranging from sound artists game accessibility researchers mobile game developers and mainstream video gamers most audio games run on a personal computer platform although there are a few audio games for handhelds and video game consoles audio games feature the same variety of genres as video games such as adventure games racing games etc audio game history the term electronic game is commonly understood as a synonym for the narrower concept of the video game this is understandable as both electronic games and video games have developed in parallel and the game market has always had a strong bias toward the visual the first electronic game in fact is often cited to be cathoderay tube amusement device 1947 a decidedly visual game despite the difficulties in creating a visual component to early electronic games imposed by crude graphics small viewscreens and power consumption video games remained the primary focus of the early electronic game market arcade and oneoff handheld audio games the early years the 1978 handheld version of ataris touch me one of the earliest audio games atari released the first audio game touch me in 1974 housed in an arcade cabinet touch me featured a series of lights which would flash with an accompanying tone the player would reproduce the sequence by pressing a corresponding sequence of buttons and then the game would add another lightsound to the end of the growing sequence to continually test the players eidetic memory in a pelmanismstyle format although the game featured both a visual and an auditory component the disconnect between the two enabled both the seeing and the visually impaired to equally enjoy the game based on the popularity of touch me in 1978 milton bradley company released a handheld audio game entitled simon at studio 54 in new york city whereas touch me had been in competition with other visualcentric video games and consequently remained only a minor success the allure of a personal electronic game allowed simon to capture a much greater share of the market simon became an immediate success eventually becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1980s in the decades following the release of simon numerous clones and variations were produced including merlin among others beginning in 1996 milton bradley and a number of other producers released the handheld bop it which featured a similar concept of a growing series of commands designed to test eidetic memory tts software and the pc the second wave colossal cave adventure 1976 the earliest of a library initially spanning 8 years of ttsenabled video games was first made widely available as an audio game through macintalk in 1984 before graphical operating systems like windows most home computers used textbased operating systems such as dos being textbased meant that they were relatively accessible to visually impaired users requiring only the additional use of texttospeech tts software for the same reason following the development of tts software textbased games such as early textonly works of interactive fiction were also equally accessible to users with or without a visual impairment accessibility for the visually impaired began to change some time prior to the advent of graphical operating systems as computers became powerful enough to support more videocentric games this created a gap between electronic games for the seeing and games for the blind a gap that has by now grown substantially due to a strong market bias in favor of the seeing electronic games were primarily developed for this demographic while seeing gamers could venture into 3d gaming worlds in such video game titles as myst final fantasy and doom blind gamers were relegated to playing more mundane games such as blackjack or battleship as video games flourished and became increasingly common however amateur game designers began to adapt video games for the blind via sound in time audio game programmers began to develop audioonly games based to a smaller and smaller degree on existing video game ideas and instead focusing on the possibilities of game immersion and feedback with sound specifically threedimensional positional audio binaural recording has been developed since 2000 and now figures prominently in for example such audio games as bbbeat to effect this a sound is played in the left center or right channel to indicate an objects position in a virtual gaming environment generally this involves stereo panning of various sound effects many of which are looped to serve as indicators of hazards or objects with which the user can interact volume also plays a major role in 3d audio games primarily to indicate an objects proximity with reference to the user the pitch of a sound is often varied to convey other information about the object it symbolizes voice talent is used to indicate menu items rather than text these parameters have allowed for the creation of among other genres side scrollers 3d action adventures shooters and arcade style games console audio games and the modern era most audio games are now developed by several small companies consisting of only a team of one to four people the main audience remains primarily visually impaired users however the game market at large is gradually taking more notice of audio games as well due to the issue of game accessibility commercial interest in audio games has steadily grown and as a result artists and students have created a number of experimental freeware pc audio games to explore the possibilities and limitations of this gaming form recently audio games have also become very interesting for the mobile gaming market since no screen is needed warps real sound kaze no regret 1997 in the field of consolegaming there has been very little in the way of audiogames one notable exception has been the innovative incorporation of strong audio elements in several of the games produced by the japanese video game company warp warp formerly eim was founded by musician kenji eno and consisted of a fiveman team including firsttime designer fumito ueda this game featured no visuals at all and was entirely dependent upon sound discussing real sounds production eno has stated that i got tired of i didnt want people to think that they could predict what warp would do next also i had a chance to visit people who are visually disabled and i learned that there are blind people who play action games of course theyre not able to have the full experience and theyre kind of trying to force themselves to be able to play but theyre making the effort so i thought that if you turn off the monitor both of you are just hearing the game so after you finish the game you can have an equal conversation about it with a blind person thats an inspiration behind this game as well so sega was asking for exclusive rights to the game and i said ok if youll donate a thousand saturns to blind people then ill donate a thousand following the release of real sound warp again made use of a novel employment of audio elements in the sega saturn game enemy zero 1997 where the enemies of the game are invisible and can only be detected through auditory clues which both incorporate soundtracks created by eno warp stopped production of video games in 2000 and changed their name to superwarp following a number of problems with video game producers mixed reviews of the games and markedly mediocre sales nintendo as part of its shift to alternative gameplay forms has shown recent interest in audio games through its own development teams in 2008 mit students collaborated with the government of singapore and a professor at the national university of singapore to create audiodyssey a game which allows both blind and sighted gamers to play together apples iphone platform has become home to a number of audio games including papa sangre ttsenabling video games the rise of texttospeech tts software and steady improvements in the field have allowed full audioconversion of traditionally videobased games such games were intended for use by and marketed to the seeing however they do not actually rest primarily on the visual aspects of the game and so members of the audio game community have been able to convert them to audio games by using them in conjunction with tts software while this was originally only available for strictly textbased games like text adventures and muds advances in tts software have led to increased functionality with a diverse array of software types beyond textonly media allowing other works of interactive fiction as well as various simulator games to be enjoyed in a strictly audio environment examples of such games include a dark room doublespeak games 2013 hattrick extralives ab 1997 ogame gameforge 2002 jennifer government

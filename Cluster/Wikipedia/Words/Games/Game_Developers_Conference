notable industry figures are invited to speak on industryrelated subjects they are passionate about according to zimmerman the idea of the panel is to really take those grumblings and mutterings and bring them out into the light speak truth to power cut through to the real s and talk about what is going on in our industrywhats wrong and what we can do to change it many rants inspire controversy discussion and a good deal of media coverage in industry press most rant sessions focus on a particular segment of the industry to draw their speakers from 2005 burning down the house game developers

apocalypse the 10th anniversary mega session the rant panel has inspired similarly structured sessions with more specialized topics eg game educators rant during the education summit or rants during the indie game summit game design challenge eric zimmerman created the game design challenge the idea of the challenge he said was to give everyone a sense of the process behind game design and to attempt to get everyone thinking about new kinds of games no actual game needs to be built just designed the goal of the 2nd annual game design challenge was to create a game based on emily dickinson it was won by will wright who designed an emily dickinson personality simulator contained entirely on a usb flash drive the personality would interact with the player by sending instant messages and email the goal was to maintain a stable relationship and avoid the two extremes romantic obsession with the player or suicidal depression the first occurrence meant constant interruptions when using the computer the latter occurrence allowed for the simulation to delete itself the 3rd time the task was to create a game worthy of a nobel prize harvey smith won with his peacebomb game it would utilize wireless devices to organize flash mobs to engage in random acts of charity for the first 3 challenges eric zimmerman has always ended the challenge by indicating that all the contestants ideas could really be made into a game the goal of the 4th annual game design challenge was to create a game which was a religion or which could become one it was won by jason rohrer who designed a oneplayer at a time multiplayer game named chain world contained entirely on a usb flash drive experimental gameplay workshop the experimental gameplay workshop is a twohour workshop that showcases

success in the genre other games in the genre range from citybuilding games like caesar or dwarf fortress pure business simulation games like capitalism and or true cmss like theme park cmss are often called simulation games for short although games can simulate many activities from vehicles to sports players usually deduce the kind of simulation from the title of the game gameplay economic challenges economics play a primary role in construction and management simulations because they allow players to build things while operating within economic constraints construction mechanisms in cmss tend to be one of two types planandbuild where the construction is completed gradually or purchase and place where the construction appears immediately goals cmss are usually single player games as competition would force players to eschew creativity in favor of efficiency and a race to accumulate resources unlike other genres construction and management simulations seldom offer a progression in storyline and the level design is a simple space where the player can build some games offer prebuilt scenarios which include victory conditions such as reaching a level of wealth or surviving worsening conditions but success in one scenario seldom affects another scenario and players can usually try them in any order interface an example of a windowed interface from the game openttd because the player must manage a complex internal economy construction and management simulations frequently make use of a windowed interface the player in a cms is usually omnipresent and does not have an avatar as such the player is usually given an isometric perspective of the world or a freeroaming camera from an aerial viewpoint for modern 3d games history the sumer game a later version of which was called hamurabi was a relatively simple textonly game originally written for the dec pdp8 in which the player controlled the economy of a citystate utopia was released in 1982 for the intellivision and is credited as the game that spawned the construction and management simulation genre in 1983 koei released the historical simulation game nobunagas ambition where the player takes the role of the historical figure oda nobunaga and must conquer unify and manage the nation of japan it combines number crunching japanese history and grand strategy simulation including elements such as raising taxes and giving rice to prefectures utopia had a notable influence on simcity in 1989 subgenres several more specific genres have developed over time citybuilding games citybuilding game citybuilding game is a subgenre of cms where players act as a cityplanner or leader players normally look at the city from a point of view high in the sky to grow and manage a simulated city players are only allowed to control building placement and city management features such as salaries and work priorities while actual building is done by game citizens who are nonplayable characters this is in many of the construction and management simulation though it doesnt have to be a city it could be a kingdom as in goodgame empire or age of empires or maybe a zoo or other type of land that involve the aspects of construction and management and is able to make a simulation of it evolution of the subgenre the city building game genre was established in 1989 with simcity which emphasized continuous building versus competing to win and blowing stuff up players followed personal preferences in design and growth indicators of success were maintaining positive budget balance and citizen satisfaction subsequent simcity titles soon followed when high sales of the game demonstrated its popularity the first sim game utopia 1982 covered many of these same elements but the primitive screen resolutions of its era meant that it displayed two islands because the detail necessary to show cities was not possible unlike the thousands of individual spaces possible a few years later in simcity each island held approximately 16 buildable spaces for schools factories etc the players score was based on the wellbeing of their people a second boost in genre popularity came in 1992 with the publishing of caesar which modeled cities in ancient rome replacing electricity and mass transit with aqueducts and roads subsequent titles in the city building series followed all modeling cities in past civilizations in 1993 the dungeons dragons pc game stronghold appeared which was advertised as simcity meets dd in 3d elves humans and dwarfs each built neighborhoods with unique architecture within the players town the title also had elements of realtime strategy games when enemies attacked the city and the line between citybuilding and rts games has often been blurred with this kind of hybrid title true 3d graphics were not yet possible in 1993 and the advertised 3d was actually a clever use of 2d graphics with mathematically generated terrain and overlaid bitmaps and sprites theme park management see also list of roller coaster related video games the earliest known theme park management game is theme park the idea for the genre was attributed to programmer peter molyneux who thought that the genre was worth pursuing the series would later become a success spawning several sequels including rollercoaster tycoon 2 and rollercoaster tycoon 3 after the release of rollercoaster tycoon 3 the genre went dormant for nearly a decade colony management the colony management genre has fewer titles compared to the other subgenres due to the niche market these games utilize construction and management extensively with incredible detail in more aspects of the game than other genres notable titles include dwarf fortress and rimworld the latter of which takes inspiration from the former business simulation games business simulation game business simulation games are a subset of cmss that simulate a business or some other economy these games typically involve more management than construction rather than investing in physical buildings construction can be abstract such as purchasing stocks the closest example of a pure economic simulation may be capitalism the goal of which is to build an industrial and financial empire another highly ambitious business simulator is transport tycoon active development of internet technologies and the growth of the internet audience in recent years gave a powerful impetus to the development of the industry of online games and in particular online business simulations there are many varieties of online business simulationsbrowserbased and downloadable singleplayer and multiplayer realtime and turnbased among the most notable online business simulations such as virtonomics or industryplayer

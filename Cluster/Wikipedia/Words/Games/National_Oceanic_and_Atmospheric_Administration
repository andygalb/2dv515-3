administration noaa no like noah is an american scientific agency within the united states department of commerce that focuses on the conditions of the oceans major waterways and the atmosphere noaa warns of dangerous weather charts seas guides the use and protection of ocean and coastal resources and conducts research to provide understanding and improve stewardship of the environment noaa was officially formed in 1970 since october 2017 noaa has been headed by timothy gallaudet as acting under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and noaa interim administrator purpose and function two noaa wp3d orions noaa plays several specific roles in society the benefits of which extend beyond the us economy and into the larger global community a supplier of environmental information products noaa supplies to its customers and partners information pertaining to the state of the oceans and the atmosphere this is clear through the production of weather warnings and forecasts via the national weather service but noaas information products extend to climate ecosystems and commerce as well a provider of environmental stewardship services noaa is a steward of us coastal and marine environments in coordination with federal state local tribal and international authorities noaa manages the use of these environments regulating fisheries and marine sanctuaries as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine species a leader in applied scientific research noaa is intended to be a source of accurate and objective scientific information in the four particular areas of national and global importance identified above ecosystems climate weather and water and commerce and transportation the five fundamental activities are monitoring and observing earth systems with instruments and data collection networks understanding and describing earth systems through research and analysis of that data assessing and predicting the changes of these systems over time engaging advising and informing the public and partner organizations with important information managing resources for the betterment of society economy and environment history noaa traces its history back to multiple agencies united states coast and geodetic survey formed in 1807 weather bureau of the united states formed in 1870 bureau of commercial fisheries formed in 1871 research fleet only coast and geodetic survey corps formed in 1917 another direct predecessor of noaa was the environmental science services administration essa into which several existing scientific agencies such as the united states coast and geodetic survey the weather bureau and the uniformed corps were absorbed in 1965 noaa was established within the department of commerce via the reorganization plan no 4 for exploration and development leading to the intelligent use of our marine resources in 2007 noaa celebrated 200 years of service in its role as successor to the united states survey of the coast organizational structure noaa headquarters in silver spring maryland noaa administrator since october 25 2017 timothy gallaudet assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere has

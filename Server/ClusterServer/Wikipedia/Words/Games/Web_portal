of the user in an organization may determine which content can be added to the portal or deleted from the portal configuration a portal may use a search engines application programming interface api to permit users to search intranet content as opposed to extranet content by restricting which domains may be searched apart from this common search engines feature web portals may offer other services such as email news stock quotes information from databases and even entertainment content portals provide a way for enterprises and organizations to provide a consistent look and feel with

were faced with increasing content and user management challenges a consolidated view of company information was judged insufficient users wanted personalization and customization webmasters if skilled enough were able to offer some capabilities but for the most part ended up driving users away from using the intranet many companies began to offer tools to help webmasters manage their data applications and information more easily and by providing different users with personalized views portal solutions can also include workflow management collaboration between work groups or branches and policymanaged content publication most can allow internal and external access to specific corporate information using secure authentication or single signon jsr168 standards emerged around 2001 java specification request jsr 168 standards allow the interoperability of portlets across different portal platforms these standards allow portal developers administrators and consumers to integrate standardsbased portals and portlets across a variety of vendor solutions the concept of content aggregation seems to still gain momentum and portal solution will likely continue to evolve significantly over the next few years the gartner group predicts generation 8 portals to expand on the business mashups concept of delivering a variety of information tools applications and access points through a single mechanism with the increase in usergenerated content blog posts comments photos disparate data silos and file formats information architects and taxonomists will be required to allow users the ability to tag classify the data or content for example if a vicepresident makes a blog post this post could be tagged with herhis name title and the subject of the post tagging makes it easier for users of the intranet to find the content they are interested in this will ultimately cause a ripple effect where users will also be generating ad hoc navigation and information flows

hosted hosted web portals gained popularity and a number of companies began offering them as a hosted service the hosted portal market fundamentally changed the composition of portals in many ways they served simply as a tool for publishing information instead of the loftier goals of integrating legacy applications or presenting correlated data from distributed databases the early hosted portal companies such as hyperofficecom or the now defunct internetportalcom focused on collaboration and scheduling in addition to the distribution of corporate data as hosted web portals have risen in popularity their feature set has grown to include hosted databases document management email discussion forums and more hosted portals automatically personalize the content generated from their modules to provide a personalized experience to their users in this regard they have remained true to the original goals of the earlier corporate web portals emerging new classes of internet portals

present the user with a single web page that brings together or aggregates content from a number of other systems or servers the application server or architecture performs most of the crucial functions of the application this application server is in turn connected to database servers and may be part of a clustered server environment highcapacity portal configurations may include load balancing strategies for portals that present application functionality to the user the portal server is in reality the front piece of a server configuration that includes some connectivity to the application server for early web browsers permitting html frameset and iframe elements diverse information could be presented without violating the browser samesource security policy relied upon to prevent a variety of crosssite security breaches more recent clientside technologies rely on javascript frameworks and libraries that rely on more recent web functionality such as websockets and asynchronous callbacks using xmlhttprequests the server hosting the portal may only be a pass through for the user by use of portlets application functionality can be presented in any number of portal pages for the most part this architecture is transparent to the user in such a design security and concurrent user capacity can be important issues and security designers need to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can generate requests to the application server if the security design and administration does not ensure adequate authentication and authorization then the portal may inadvertently present vulnerabilities to various types of attacks standards web services for remote portlets v1 jsr 168 java jsr 286 java portlet v20 definition standard applet client portal

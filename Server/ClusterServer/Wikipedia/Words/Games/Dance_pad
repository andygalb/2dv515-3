although homebrew hard pads often feature additional functions such as additional inputs see below solid state solid state pads replace the usual mechanical switch and contact used in other hard pads a proximity sensor is used to detect a players steps on the pad the advantages of a solid state design is that they do not require pressure to activate eliminating moving parts that might break down and keeping dirt from getting into the mechanism caveats problems are often encountered when attempting to use a playstation pad with a computer simulator most playstationpc adapters will not register up and down or left and right simultaneously initially although they are common jumps in dance games this is because normal playstation games do not require such input and because dpads are not usually designed to physically permit such input stepmanias website has a section concerning adapter compatibility although these devices may work on a pc to date the adapters will not work with consoles that have built in usb ports such as the playstation 3 and the xbox 360 purchasers of home pads should be aware of the number and arrangement of active arrow panels that are required by the

circuit board from a standard controller to simplify the process of interfacing the pad with a gaming system the controller used depends on the system that the pad is intended to be played with gamecube playstation xbox or pc homebrew pads use a variety of technologies for designing the arrows that the player is supposed to step on the most common design uses metal contacts that sandwich together when the player steps on the pad or arcade button switches but some novel ideas have been proposed such as the use of optical pressure vibration or proximity sensors due to the amount of work needed to create a custom metal pad some players instead opt to modify their existing soft pads most of the time players will sometimes take plywood sheets acrylic or office chair floor protectors and staple it to their soft pads this effectively cures wrinkling and makes the pad more durable to use while wearing shoes educational use systems for multiple simultaneous players were introduced into

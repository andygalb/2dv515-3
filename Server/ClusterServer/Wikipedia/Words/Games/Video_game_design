developers list of video game developers list of video game industry people list of video game publishers list of video game websites vte video game design is the process of designing the content and rules of a video game in the preproduction stage as the industry has aged and embraced alternative production methodologies such as agile the role of a principal game designer has begun to separate some studios emphasising the auteur model while others emphasising a more team oriented model within the video game industry video game design is usually just referred to as game design which is a more general term elsewhere video game programmers have also sometimes comprised the entire design team this is the case of such noted designers as sid meier john romero chris sawyer and will wright a notable exception to this policy was coleco which from its very start separated the function of design and programming as games became more complex and computers and consoles became more powerful the job of the game designer became separate from the lead programmer soon game complexity demanded team members focused on game design many early veterans chose the game design path eschewing programming and delegating those tasks to others with very complex games such as mmorpgs or a big budget action or sports title designers may number in the dozens in these cases there are generally one or two principal designers and many junior designers who specify subsets or subsystems of the game in larger companies like electronic arts each aspect of the game control level design may have a separate producer lead designer and several general designers they may also come up with a plot for the game overview see also game design video game design starts with an idea many decisions are made during the course of a games development about the games design it is the responsibility of the designer to decide which elements will be implemented based on for example consistency with the games vision budget or hardware limitations the designer may use scripting languages to implement and preview design ideas without necessarily modifying the games codebase a game designer often plays video games and demos to follow the game market development it is common for the game designers name to misleadingly be given an undue amount of association to the game neglecting the rest of the development team funding game publishers must be taken into account who may have specific expectations from a game in rules of play 2004 katie salen and eric zimmermann write a game designer is a particular kind of designer much like a graphic designer industrial designer or architect a game designer is not necessarily a programmer visual designer or project manager although sometimes he or she can also play these roles in the creation of a game a game designer might work alone or as part of a larger team a game designer might create card games social games video games or any other kind of game the focus of a game designer is designing game play conceiving and designing rules and structures that result in an experience for players thus game design as a discipline requires a focus on games in and of themselves rather than placing games in the service of another field such as sociology literary criticism or computer science our aim is to study games within their own disciplinary space because game design is an emerging discipline we often borrow from other areas of knowledge from mathematics and cognitive science from semiotics and cultural studies we may not borrow in the most orthodox manner but we do so in the service of helping to establish a field of game design proper game designer a game designer is a person who designs gameplay conceiving and designing the rules and structure of a game lead designer coordinates the work of other designers and is the main visionary of the game lead designer may be the founder of a game development company or a promoted employee game mechanics designer or systems designer designs and balances the games rules level designer or environment designer is a position becoming prominent in the recent years compensation in 2010 a game designer with more than six years of experience earned an average of us65000 gbp gb4476122 54000 gbp 3718624 with three to six years of experience and 44000 gbp 3029990 with less than 3 years of experience lead designers earned 75000 gbp 5164756 with three to six years of experience and 95000gbp 6542024 with more than six years of experience disciplines world design world design is the creation of a backstory setting and theme for the game often done by a lead designer system design system design is the creation of game rules and underlying mathematical patterns content design content design is the creation of characters items puzzles and missions a secondary definition of content design is the creation of any aspect of the game that is not required for the game to function properly and meet the minimum viable product standard in essence content is the complexity added to a minimum viable product to increase its value an example of this is the item list from final fantasy none of the items are necessary for the game to function but they add value and complexity to the game as a whole game writing video game writing game writing involves writing dialogue text and story writing in games also includes the elements in which the literature is presented voice acting text and music are all elements of game writing level design level design level design is the construction of world levels and its features level design makes use of many different fields to create a game world lighting space framing color and contrast are used to draw a players attention a designer can then use these elements to guide or direct the player in a specific direction through the game world or mislead them user interface design user interface ui design deals with the construction the user interactions and feedback interface like menus or headsup displays the user interface also incorporates game mechanics design deciding how much information to give the player and in what way allows the designer to inform the player about the world or perhaps leave them uninformed another aspect to consider is the method of input a game will use and deciding to what degree a player can interact with a game with these inputs these choices have a profound effect on the mood of the game as it directly affects the player in both noticeable and subtle ways user interface design in video games has unique goals a conscious decision has to be made regarding the amount of information to relay to the player however the ui in games do not have to be absolutely streamlined players expect challenges and are willing to accept them as long as the experience is sufficiently rewarding by the same token navigating or interaction with a games ui can be satisfying without the need to be effortless audio design audio design involves the process of creating or incorporating all of the sounds that are in the game like sound effects or voice acting game feel the disciplines listed above all combine to form the discipline of game feel game elements narrative further information narrative designer numerous games have narrative elements which give a context to an event in a game making the activity of playing it less abstract and enhance its entertainment value although narrative elements are not always clearly present or present at all the original version of tetris is an example of a game apparently without narrative some gameplay further information gameplay gameplay is the interactive aspects of video game design gameplay involves player interaction with the game usually for the purpose of entertainment education or training design process the design process varies from designer to designer and companies have different formal procedures and philosophies the typical textbook approach is to start with a concept or a previously completed game and from there create a game design document this document is intended to map out the complete game design and acts as a central resource for the development team this document should ideally be updated as the game evolves throughout the production process designers are frequently expected to adapt to multiple roles of widely varying nature for example concept prototyping can be assisted with the use of preexisting engines and tools like gamemaker studio unity godot or construct level designs might be done first on paper and again for the game engine using a 3d modelling tool scripting languages are used for many elementsai cutscenes gui environmental processes and many other behaviours and effectsthat designers would want to tune without a programmers assistance setting story and character concepts require a research and writing process designers may oversee focus testing write up art and audio asset lists and write game documentation in addition to the skillset designers are ideally clear communicators with attention to detail and ability to delegate responsibilities appropriately design approval in the commercial setting is a continuous process from the earliest stages until the game ships when a new project is being discussed either internally or as a result of dialogue with potential publishers the designer may be asked to write a sellsheet of short concepts followed by a one or twopage pitch of specific features audience platform and other details designers will first meet with leads in other departments to establish agreement on the feasibility of the game given the available time scope and budget if the pitch is approved early milestones focus on the creation of a fleshedout design document some developers advocate a prototyping phase before the design document is written to experiment with new ideas before they become part of the design as production progresses designers are asked to make frequent decisions about elements missing from the design the consequences of these decisions are hard to predict and often can only be determined after creating the full implementation these are referred to as the unknowns of the design and the faster they are uncovered the less risk the team faces later in the production process outside factors such as budget cuts or changes in milestone expectations also result in cuts to the design and while overly large cuts can take the heart out of a project cuts can also result in a streamlined design with only the essential features polished well towards the end of production designers take the brunt of responsibility for ensuring that the gameplay remains at a uniform standard throughout the game even in very long games this task is made more difficult under crunch conditions as the entire team may begin to lose sight of the core gameplay once pressured to hit a date for a finished and bugfree game game development portal

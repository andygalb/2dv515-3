sports most sports have been recreated with a game including team sports track and field extreme sports and combat sports some games emphasize actually playing the sport such as the madden nfl series

and are updated annually to reflect realworld changes sports genre is one of the oldest genres in gaming history game design sports games involve physical and tactical challenges and test the players precision and accuracy sports games sometimes make use of different modes for different parts of the game this is especially true in games about american football such as the madden nfl series where executing a pass play requires six different gameplay modes in the span of approximately 45 seconds older 2d sports games sometimes used an unrealistic graphical scale where athletes appeared to be quite large in order to be visible to the player as sports games have evolved players have come to expect a realistic graphical scale with a high degree of verisimilitude sports games sometimes treat buttonpushes as continuous signals rather than discrete moves in order to initiate and end a continuous action for example football games may distinguish between short and the long passes based on how long the player holds a button golf games often initiate the backswing with one buttonpush and the swing itself is initiated by a subsequent push history see also history of video games beginnings of

thin invisible beams of infrared light when something such as a players arm or leg ineerrupts a beam the device reads the distance at which the interruption occurred and interprets the signal as a command the device can also interpret signals from multiple beams simultaneously ie chords as a distinct command sega designed especial activator motions for a few of their own game releases by tailoring motion signals specifically for a game sega attempted to provide a more intuitive gaming experience a player could for example compete in greatest heavyweights of the ring or eternal champions by miming punches despite these efforts the activator was a commercial failure like the power glove of 1989 it was widely rejected for its unwieldiness and inaccuracy wii remote ir motion

the first official title to feature both mario and sonic the hedgehog in which players used the wii remote to simulate running jumping and other olympic sports sports games today the sports genre is currently dominated by ea sports and 2k sports who hold licenses to produce games based on official leagues eas franchises include the madden nfl series the nhl series the fifa series and the nba live series 2k sports franchises include the wwe 2k series nhl 2k and the nba 2k series all of these games feature real leagues competitions and players these games continue to sell well today despite many of the product lines being over a decade old and receive for the most part consistently good reviews with 2k ea sports domination the market has become very difficult to enter competing games in any of the above genres with the exception of racing games tend to be unsuccessful this has led to a sharp drop in sportsthemed titles over recent years one of the most notable exceptions is konamis pro evolution soccer series which is often hailed as an alternative to the fifa series but does not contain as many licensed teams players kits or competitions another deviation from the norm is sonys mlb the show series which now has a monopoly on the baseball genre after the withdrawal of 2k after mlb 2k13 nintendo has been able to make an impact upon the sports market by producing several mariothemed titles such as super mario strikers mario hoops 3on3 mario tennis open and mario golf world tour these titles sell respectfully but are only available on nintendos video game consoles for

nature of sports lends itself well to the arcades where the main objective is usually to obtain a high score the arcade style of play is generally more unrealistic and focuses on a quicker gameplay experience however the competitive nature of sports and being able to gain a high score while compete against friends for free online has made online sports games very popular examples of this include the nfl blitz and nba jam series simulation simulation games are more realistic than arcade games with the emphasis being more on realism than on how fun the game is to pick up and play simulation games tend to be slower and more accurate while arcade games tend to be fast and can have all kinds of adhoc rules and ideas thrown in especially pre2000 for example nba jam had only two players on each team and there was a nes game where every bicycle kick performed no matter where in the field it was made the screen flash and ended up as a goal management a sports management game puts the player in the role of team manager whereas some games are played online against other players management games usually pit the player against ai controlled teams in the same league players are expected to handle strategy tactics transfers and financial issues various examples of these games can be found in the sports management category multisport since track field games have combined multiple sports into a single game wii sports and wii sports resort are recent examples multisport tournaments are becoming the basis for computer games sportsbased fighting sportsbased fighting games are titles that fall firmly within the definitions of both the fighting game and sports game genre such as boxing and wrestling video games as such they are usually put in their own separate subgenres often the fighting is far more realistic than in traditional fighting games though the amount of realism can greatly vary and many feature realworld franchises or fighters examples of this include the fight night ufc 2009 undisputed and wwe 2k series games and televised sports more and more video sports games are starting to look and act like their tv counterparts as developers focus on creating realistic commentary and cameraangles additionally televised sports namely american football have started to model some of their cameras on those seen in video games chronology of baseball video games

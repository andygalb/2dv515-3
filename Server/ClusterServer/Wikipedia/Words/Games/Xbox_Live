xbox live xbox live is an online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery service created and operated by microsoft it was first made available to the xbox system in november 2002 an updated version of the service became available for the xbox 360 console at the systems launch in november 2005 and a further enhanced version was released in 2013 with the xbox one the service was extended in 2007 on the windows platform named games for windows live which makes most aspects of the system available on windows computers microsoft has announced plans to extend live to other platforms such as handhelds and mobile phones as part of the live anywhere initiative the xbox live service is available as both a free service known as xbox live silver and a subscriptionbased service known as xbox live gold respectively with most features such as online gaming restricted to the gold service history the second xbox live logo used from 2005 until 2013 as microsoft developed the original xbox console online gaming was designated as one of the key pillars for the greater xbox strategy sega had made an attempt to capitalize on the evergrowing online gaming scene when it launched the dreamcast video game console in 1999 including online support as standard called seganet and dreamarena nevertheless due to lack of widespread broadband adoption at the time the dreamcast shipped with only a dialup modem while a laterreleased broadband adapter was neither widely supported nor widely available downloadable content was available though limited in size due to the narrowband connection and the size limitations of a memory card the online features while praised as innovative were largely considered a failure and the dreamcasts immediate competitor the playstation 2 did not initially ship with builtin networking capabilities microsoft however hoped that the xbox would succeed where the dreamcast had failed the company determined that intense online gaming required the throughput of a broadband connection and the storage space of a hard disk drive and thus these features would be vital to the new platform this would allow not only for significant downloadable content such as new levels maps weapons challenges and characters to be downloaded quickly and stored but also would make it possible to standardize bandwidth intensive features such as voice communication steve ballmer and bill gates both had a vision of making premium download content and addons that would attract many new customers based on this reasoning the console included a standard ethernet port 10100 in order to provide connectivity to common broadband networks but did not include a modem or any dialup support and its online service was designed to support broadband users only critics scoffed at it citing poor broadband adoption at the turn of the century when the xbox launched on november 15 2001 the asyet unnamed online service was destined for a summer 2002 deployment utilizing the required broadband bandwidth xbox live featured a unified gaming friends list as well as a single identity across all titles regardless of the publisher and standardized voice chat with a headset and communication a feature that was still in its infancy leading up to the launch microsoft enlisted several waves of beta testers to improve the service and receive feature feedback the first wave of beta testers were given revolt which never was released officially and nfl fever 2003 to beta test once beta testing concluded microsoft sent these beta testers a translucent orange memory card a headset carrying case and a beta tester tshirt with the slogan i have great hands when the service debuted it lacked much of the functionality that later titles included but xbox live grew and evolved on the xbox and many aspects of the service were included with the xbox 360 console out of the box rather than through a later update microsofts 5000th patent was liverelated and gave xbox 360 users access to watch other gamers compete against each other over xbox live the packaging for playable xbox live titles on the original xbox console featured the trademark gold bar underneath the xbox header tom clancys splinter cell and brute force sported a live bubble design as they only featured downloadable content it was changed later wherein all xbox live titles included the universal gold live bar by the time of the xbox 360 all titles were required to provide at least a limited form of xbox live awareness on november 15 2007 microsoft celebrated xbox lives 5th anniversary by offering its then over 8million subscribers the title carcassonne free of charge and awarding gamers who had subscribed to live since its inception 500 free microsoft points due to intermittent service interruptions during late december 2007 and early january 2008 microsoft promised to offer a free xbox live arcade game to all xbox live users as compensation in an open letter to all xbox live

public pictures which are shown to all that view a profile unless the user has a different personal picture set which can be taken of avatars while using the avatar editor users were formerly forbidden to use strings such as gay or refer to homosexuality in any way in their gamertag or profile due to it being considered content of a sexual nature even if the string occurs in a legitimate surname incidents where a woman was suspended from the service for identifying herself as a lesbian and an incident where a male user was suspended for using his surname gaywood in his username attracted controversy gamerscore the gamerscore g is an achievements point accumulation system that reflects the number of achievements accumulated by a user on xbox live through the displaying of the number of points accumulated these achievement points are awarded for the completion of gamespecific challenges such as beating a level or amassing a specified number of wins against other players in online matches and other various in game challenges initially retail xbox 360 games offered up to 1000g spread over a variable number of achievements while each xbox live arcade title contained 12 achievements totaling 200g on february 1 2007 microsoft announced on their gamerscore blog some new policies that developers must follow related to gamerscore and achievements in future releases but some xbla games now contain up to 400 gamerscore without dlc on may 26 2007 halo 2 was the first games for windows title to feature achievements which counted towards a players gamerscore on march 25 2008 microsoft cracked down on gamerscore cheaters those who used external tools to artificially inflate their gamerscore and reduced their gamerscores to zero without the option to recover the scores that had been earned and branded the player by denoting on their gamertag that they were a cheater the development of the gamerscore system has created a new niche in the internet economy many websites have been created to provide gamers with tips and tricks for getting achievement points some sites are solely devoted to these achievement guides and some blogs provide gaming guides in addition to their other content on march 13 2014 ray cox iv or stallion83 became the first player in history to reach 1 million gamerscore gamercard the gamercard is an information panel used to summarize ones user profile on microsofts xbox live the pieces of information on a gamercard include gamertag in front a silver or gold bar active gold members who have had xbox live for less than a year feature small bubbles anything a year or over will feature the number of years gamer picture avatar reputation gamerscore gamer zone recent games played a players gamercard can be viewed via the xbox 360 dashboard or online through xboxcom the top bar that displays the gamertag is shown in front of either a silver or gold bar which designates if the gamer has an xbox live free or gold subscription respectively if the gamer is part of the xbox 360 launch team the top bar will also have additional text stating launch team in the background thirdparty sites allow users to post a rendered version of their gamercard as a small flash applet or jpeg image on any website or internet forum similarly mac os x users can download widgets that display their xbox live gamercard within mac os xs dashboard these can be downloaded onto any mac with os x 104 or higher via apples widget download page there are four gamer zones recreation is for casual gamers family is for familyfriendly gamers without profanity etc pro is for competitive gamers who enjoy a challenge and underground is for noholdsbarred gaming where anything goes as long as it does not violate the xbox live terms of use however in practice these gamer zones are displayed only on the gamercard of the player and do not tend to affect the gameplay experience or the matching of players in online games trueskill trueskill trueskill and in the games for windows live game warhammer 40000 dawn of war ii it uses a mathematical model of uncertainty to address weaknesses in existing ranking systems such as elo for example a new player joining millionplayer leagues can be ranked correctly in fewer than 20 games it can predict the probability of each game outcome which enhances competitive matchmaking making it possible to assemble skillbalanced teams from a group of players with different abilities when matchmaking the system attempts to match individuals based on their estimated skill level if two individuals are competing headtohead and have the same estimated skill level with low estimate uncertainty they should each have roughly a 50 chance of winning a match in this way the system attempts to make every match as competitive as possible in order to prevent abuse of the system the majority of ranked games have relatively limited options for matchmaking by design players cannot easily play with their friends in ranked games however these countermeasures have failed due to techniques such as alternate accounts and system flaws where each system has its own individual trueskill rating to provide less competitive games the system supports unranked player matches which allow individuals of any skill level to be paired often including guests on an account such matches do not contribute to the trueskill rating xbox games store xbox games store xbox games store formerly xbox live marketplace is a unified storefront which offers both free and premium content for download including xbox

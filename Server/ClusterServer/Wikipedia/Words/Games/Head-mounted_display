head a headmounted display or helmetmounted display for aviation applications both abbreviated hmd is a display device worn on the head or as part of a helmet that has a small display optic in front of one monocular hmd or each eye binocular hmd a hmd has many uses including in gaming aviation engineering and medicine there is also an optical headmounted display ohmd which is a wearable display that can reflect projected images and allows a user to see through it a binocular headmounted display hmd a professional headmounted display hmd a man controls google glass a type of peripheral headmounted display using the touchpad built into the side of the device the oculus rift virtual reality headset a htc vive headset overview a typical hmd has one or two small displays with lenses and semitransparent mirrors embedded in eyeglasses also termed data glasses a visor or a helmet the display units are miniaturised and may include cathode ray tubes crt liquid crystal displays lcds liquid crystal on silicon lcos or organic lightemitting diodes oled some vendors employ multiple microdisplays to increase total resolution and field of view hmds differ in whether they can display only computergenerated imagery cgi or only live imagery from the physical world or combination most hmds can display only a computergenerated image sometimes referred to as virtual image some hmds can allow a cgi to be superimposed on realworld view this is sometimes referred to as augmented reality or mixed reality combining realworld view with cgi can be done by projecting the cgi through a partially reflective mirror and viewing the real world directly this method is often called optical seethrough combining realworld view with cgi can also be done electronically by accepting video from a camera and mixing it electronically with cgi this method is often called video seethrough optical hmd optical headmounted display an optical headmounted display uses an optical mixer which is made of partly silvered mirrors it can reflect artificial images and let real images cross the lens and let a user look through it various methods have existed for seethrough hmds most of which can be summarized into two main families based on curved mirrors or waveguides curved mirrors have been used by laster technologies and by vuzix in their star 1200 product various waveguide methods have existed for years these include diffraction optics holographic optics polarized optics and reflective optics applications major hmd applications include military government fire police etc and civiliancommercial medicine video gaming sports etc aviation and tactical ground helmet mounted display in 1962 hughes aircraft company revealed the electrocular a compact crt7 long headmounted monocular display that reflected a tv signal in to transparent eyepiece ruggedized hmds are increasingly being integrated into the cockpits of modern helicopters and fighter aircraft these are usually fully integrated with the pilots flying helmet and may include protective visors night vision devices and displays of other symbology military police and firefighters use hmds to display tactical information such as maps or thermal imaging data while viewing a real scene recent applications have included the use of hmd for paratroopers the defense advanced research projects agency darpa continues to fund research in augmented reality hmds as part of the persistent close air support pcas program vuzix is currently working on a system for pcas that will use holographic waveguides to produce seethrough augmented reality glasses that are only a few millimeters thick engineering engineers and scientists use hmds to provide stereoscopic views of computeraided design cad schematics virtual reality when applied to engineering and design is a key factor in integration of the human in the design by enabling engineers to interact with their designs in full lifesize scale products can be validated for issues that may not have been visible until physical prototyping the use of hmds for vr is seen as supplemental to the conventional use of cave for vr simulation hmds are predominantly used for singleperson interaction with the design while caves allow for more collaborative virtual reality sessions head mounted display systems are also used in the maintenance of complex systems as they can give a technician a simulated xray vision by combining computer graphics such as system diagrams and imagery with the technicians natural vision augmented or modified reality medicine and research there are also applications in surgery wherein a combination of radiographic data xray computed tomography cat scans and magnetic resonance imaging mri imaging is combined with the surgeons natural view of the operation and anesthesia where the patient vital signs are within the anesthesiologists field of view at all times an eye tracking hmd with led illuminators and cameras to measure eye movementsresearch universities often use hmds to conduct studies related to vision balance cognition and neuroscience as of 2010 the use of predictive visual tracking measurement to identify mild traumatic brain injury was being studied in visual tracking tests a hmd unit with eye tracking ability shows an object moving in a regular pattern people without brain injury are able to track the moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory gaming and video see also virtual reality headset disney hmd mount low cost hmd devices are available for use with 3d games and entertainment applications one of the first commercially available hmds was the forte vfx1 which was announced at consumer electronics show ces in 1994 the vfx1 had stereoscopic displays 3axis headtracking and stereo headphones another pioneer in this field was sony which released the glasstron in 1997 it had as an optional accessory a positional sensor which permitted the user to view the surroundings with the perspective moving as the head moved providing a deep sense of immersion one novel application of this technology was in the game mechwarrior 2 which permitted users of the sony glasstron or virtual ios iglasses to adopt a new visual perspective from inside the cockpit of the craft using their own eyes as visual and seeing the battlefield through their crafts own cockpit as of 2013 many brands of video glasses can be connected to video and dslr cameras making them applicable as a new age monitor as a result of the glasses ability to block out ambient light filmmakers and photographers are able to see clearer presentations of their live images the oculus rift is a virtual reality vr headmounted display created by palmer luckey that the company oculus vr is developing for virtual reality simulations and video games sports a hmd system has been developed for formula one drivers by kopin corp and the bmw group according to bmw the hmd is part of an advanced telemetry system approved for installation by the formula one racing committee to communicate to the driver wirelessly from the heart of the race pit the hmd will display critical race data while allowing the driver to continue focusing on the track pit crews control the data and messages sent to their drivers through twoway radio recon instruments released on 3 november 2011 two head mounted displays for ski goggles mod and mod live the latter based on an android operating system training and simulation paratrooper training with an hmd a key application for hmds is training and simulation allowing to virtually place a trainee in a situation that is either too expensive or too dangerous to replicate in reallife training with hmds covers a wide range of applications from driving welding and spray painting flight and vehicle simulators dismounted soldier training medical procedure training and more however a number of unwanted symptoms have been caused by prolonged use of certain types of headmounted displays and these issues must be resolved before optimal training and simulation is feasible performance parameters ability to show stereoscopic imagery a binocular hmd has the potential to display a different image to each eye this can be used to show stereoscopic images it should be borne in mind that socalled optical infinity is generally taken by flight surgeons and display experts as about 9 metres this is the distance at which given the average human eye rangefinder baseline distance between the eyes or interpupillary distance ipd of between 25 and 3inches 6 and 8cm the angle of an object at that distance becomes essentially the same from each eye at smaller ranges the perspective from each eye is significantly different and the expense of generating two different visual channels through the computergenerated imagery cgi system becomes worthwhile interpupillary distance ipd this is the distance between the two eyes measured at the pupils and is important in designing headmounted displays field of view fov humans have an fov of around 180 but most hmds offer far less than this typically a greater field of view results in a greater sense of immersion and better situational awareness most people do not have a good feel for what a particular quoted fov would look like eg 25 so often manufacturers will quote an apparent screen size most people sit about 60cm away from their monitors and have quite a good feel about screen sizes at that distance to convert the manufacturers apparent screen size to a desktop monitor position divide the screen size by the distance in feet then multiply by 2 consumerlevel hmds typically offer a fov of about 3040 whereas professional hmds offer a field of view of 60 to 150 resolution hmds usually mention either the total number of pixels or the number of pixels per degree listing the total number of pixels eg 16001200 pixels per eye is borrowed from how the specifications of computer monitors are presented however the pixel density usually specified in pixels per degree or in arcminutes per pixel is also used to determine visual acuity 60 pixels 1 arcminpixel is usually referred to as eye limiting resolution above which increased resolution is not noticed by people with normal vision hmds typically offer 10 to 20 pixels though advances in microdisplays help increase this number binocular overlap measures the area that is common to both eyes binocular overlap is the basis for the sense of depth and stereo allowing humans to sense which objects are near and which objects are far humans have a binocular overlap of about 100 50 to the left of the nose and 50 to the right the larger the binocular overlap offered by an hmd the greater the sense of stereo overlap is sometimes specified in degrees eg 74 or as a percentage indicating how much of the visual field of each eye is common to the other eye distant focus collimation optical methods may be used to present the images at a distant focus which seems to improve the realism of images that in the real world would be at a distance onboard processing and operating system some hmd vendors offer onboard operating systems such as android allowing applications to run locally on the hmd and eliminating the need to be tethered to an external device to generate video these are sometimes referred to as smart goggles to make the hmd construction lighter producers may move the processing system to connected smart necklace formfactor that would also offer the additional benefit of larger battery pack such solution would allow to design lite hmd with sufficient energy supply for dual video inputs or higher frequency timebased multiplexing see below support of 3d video formats frame sequential multiplexing sidebyside and topbottom multiplexing depth perception inside an hmd requires different images for the left and right eyes there are multiple ways to provide these separate images use dual video inputs thereby providing a completely separate video signal to each eye timebased multiplexing methods such as frame sequential combine two separate video signals into one signal by alternating the left and right images in successive frames side by side or topbottom multiplexing this method allocated half of the image to the left eye and the other half of the image to the right eye the advantage of dual video inputs is that it provides the maximum resolution for each image and the maximum frame rate for each eye the disadvantage of dual video inputs is that it requires separate video outputs and cables from the device generating the content timebased multiplexing preserves the full resolution per each image but reduces the frame rate by half for example if the signal is presented at 60hz each eye is receiving just 30hz updates this may become an issue with accurately presenting fastmoving images sidebyside and topbottom multiplexing provide fullrate updates to each eye but reduce the resolution presented to each eye many 3d broadcasts such as espn chose to provide sidebyside 3d which saves the need to allocate extra transmission bandwidth and is more suitable to fastpaced sports action relative to timebased multiplexing methods not all hmds provide depth perception some lowerend modules are essentially biocular devices where both eyes are presented with the same image 3d video players sometimes allow maximum compatibility with hmds by providing the user with a choice of the 3d format to be used peripherals the most rudimentary hmds simply project an image or symbology on a wearers visor or reticle the image is not slaved to the real world ie the image does not change based on the wearers head position more sophisticated hmds incorporate a positioning system that tracks the wearers head position and angle so that the picture or symbology displayed is congruent with the outside world using seethrough imagery head tracking slaving the imagery headmounted displays may also be used with tracking sensors that detect changes of angle and orientation when such data is available in the system computer it can be used to generate the appropriate computergenerated imagery cgi for the angleoflook at the particular time this allows the user to look around a virtual reality environment simply by moving the head without the need for a separate controller to change the angle of the imagery in radiobased systems compared to wires the wearer may move about within the tracking limits of the system eye tracking eye trackers measure the point of gaze allowing a computer to sense where the user is looking this information is useful in a variety of contexts such as user interface navigation by sensing the users gaze a computer can change the information displayed on a screen bring added details to attention etc hand tracking tracking hand movement from the perspective of the hmd allows natural interaction with content and a convenient gameplay mechanism virtual reality headset virtual reality vr augmented reality ar computermediated reality eyetap headup display hud smartglasses helmet mounted display

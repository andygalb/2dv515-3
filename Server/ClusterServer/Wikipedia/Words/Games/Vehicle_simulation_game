chronology of citybuilding video games chronology of god video games list of space flight simulator games vte vehicle simulation games are a genre of video games which attempt to provide the player with a realistic interpretation of operating various kinds of vehicles this includes automobiles aircraft watercraft spacecraft military vehicles and a variety of other vehicles the main challenge is to master driving and steering the vehicle from the perspective of the pilot or driver with most games adding another challenge such as racing or fighting rival vehicles games are often divided based on realism with some games including more realistic physics and challenges such as fuel management definition vehicle simulation games allow players to drive or fly a vehicle this vehicle can resemble a real one or a vehicle from the game designers imagination this includes vehicles in the air on the ground over water or even in space different vehicle simulations can involve a variety of goals including racing combat or simply the experience of driving a vehicle these games normally allow the player to experience action from the visual perspective of the pilot or driver game design goals and challenges microsoft flight simulator focuses solely on the experience of flying an aircraft in contrast to other games with missions and goals the essential gameplay in a vehicle simulation is the physical and tactical challenge of driving a vehicle but most vehicle simulations involve some form of competition or race with a clear winner and loser realism and physics the market for vehicle simulators is divided between the purists and the casual players in both driving games and flight simulators players have come to expect a high degree of verisimilitude where vehicles are scaled to realistic sizes these games will add variety by having a variety of vehicles with different performance characteristics such as sharper turning or faster speed nondriving roles although vehicle simulations focus on driving a vehicle many games involve nondriving roles for more detailed racing simulations the player may sometimes play the role of a mechanic who repairs or augments their vehicle in games with a combat element this might involve manning a separate combat station on a larger vehicle some games such as their finest hour allow players to alternate between piloting the vehicle or manning the waist or tail guns megafortress allowed players to operate five separate stations for combat and managing the vehicle subgenres and vehicle types rollings and adams note that the vast majority of vehicle simulators are flight simulators and driving usually carracing simulators boat and naval simulations further information submarine simulator most watercraft simulations are of powerboats or jet skis however there has been a growing market after nadeo introduced their virtual skipper games another rather popular sailing game is sail simulator 2010 these two games can both be played online against other sailors around the world this category includes submarine simulations which typically focus on oldfashioned submarine activities such as firing torpedoes at surface ships farming simulators farm simulators such as farming simulator series offer varying levels of farm care from agriculture production to animal husbandry and synthesis of biofuels vehicles used in farming simulator games consist mainly of tractors combines and tractor trailers because of the nature of farming there are often many different components to add to the tractor to till seed water and fertilize the land flight simulators further information flight simulator and combat flight simulator flight simulators tend to fall into military or civilian categories civilian flight simulator flightgear and microsoft flight simulator are notable example of a civilian flight simulator military flight simulators military or combat flight simulators demand that players achieve the missions objectives usually attacking enemy aircraft and ground installations racing games further information racing video game and sim racing racing video games tend to fall into organized racing and imaginary racing categories racing simulations organized racing simulators attempt to reproduce the experience of driving a racing car or motorcycle in an existing racing class indycar nascar formula 1 and so on arcade racing games less realistic racing games sometimes called imaginary or arcadelike racing games involve imaginary situations driving madly through cities or the countryside or even fantasy environments spacecraft simulators further information space flight simulator game in general game developers tend to avoid making realistic space flight simulators because they behave too slowly to interest a wide audience tank and mech simulators further information vehicular combat game and mecha vehicular combat simulators include tank simulations and mecha simulations vehicular combat game further information vehicular combat vehicular combat games also known as just vehicular combat or car combat are typically video or computer games where the primary objectives of gameplay includes vehicles armed with weapons fighting with other armed vehicles train simulator further information train simulator this genre also includes simulations of driving trains a train simulator is a computer program that simulates rail transport operations this includes other kinds of railborne vehicles such as a tram trucking simulator the first trucking simulator juggernaut the trucking simulator is a relatively new aspect of the vehicle simulation genre focusing on cargo transportation and the expansion of the players trucking business combining elements of a business simulation

nintendos wii u and switch moving away from its predecessors powerpcbased architecture xbox one marks a shift back to the x86 architecture used in the original xbox it features an amd accelerated processing unit apu built around the x8664 instruction set xbox ones controller was redesigned over the xbox 360s with a redesigned body dpad and triggers capable of delivering directional haptic feedback the console places an increased emphasis on cloud computing as well as social networking features and the ability to record and share video clips or screenshots from gameplay or livestream directly to streaming services such as mixer and twitch games can also be played offconsole via a local area network on supported windows 10 devices the console can play bluray disc and overlay live television programming from an existing settop box or a digital tuner for digital terrestrial television with an enhanced program guide the console optionally included a redesigned kinect sensor marketed as the kinect 20 providing improved motion tracking and voice recognition xbox one received mostly positive reviews for its refined controller design multimedia features and voice navigation its quieter and cooler design was praised for making the console more reliable than its predecessor onlaunch but the console was generally criticized for running games at a technically lower graphical level than the playstation 4 its original user interface was panned for being nonintuitive although changes made to it and other aspects of the consoles software postlaunch received positive reception its kinect received praise for its improved motiontracking accuracy its face recognition logins and its voice commands the original xbox one model was succeeded by xbox one s in 2016 which has a smaller form factor and support for hdr10 highdynamicrange video as well as support for 4k video playback and upscaling of games from 1080p to 4k it was praised for its smaller size its onscreen visual improvements and its lack of an external power supply but its regressions such as the lack of a native kinect port were noted a highend model xbox one x was unveiled in june 2017 and released in november it features upgraded hardware specifications and support for rendering games at 4k resolution history xbox one at e3 2013 alongside the xbox 360 e model xbox one is the successor to xbox 360 microsofts previous video game console which was introduced in 2005 as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles initial hardware for the 360s successor commonly referred to by the industry as the xbox 720 initial unveiling and subsequent changes the console was publicly unveiled under the name xbox one on may 21 2013 in a press conference designed to cover the units broad multimedia and social capabilities microsoft initially announced a different game licensing scheme for xbox one than what was used upon its release all games including those purchased at retail would be bound to the users xbox live account users could access their purchased games from any other xbox one console play games without their disc once installed and allow users to share their games with up to ten designated family members users would trade games at participating retailers and could also transfer a game directly to any xbox live friend on their list for at least 30 days but only once to synchronize licenses the console would be required to connect to the internet once every 24 hours if the console could not connect all games would be disabled until the console was connected again reaction to this digital rights management scheme was extremely negative critics felt that the changes would infringe on consumers firstsale rights for games purchased on physical media as games would only be licensed to users rather than sold and the disc itself would only be used to install the game and not confer ownership of its license or permission to resell microsoft also stated that publishers could impose restrictions or activation fees on secondhand copies of games on june 19 2013 shortly after e3 2013 microsoft announced in response to the negative reaction that it would reverse its changes to xbox ones drm and game licensing model microsoft also backtracked on a similarly controversial requirement for the kinect sensor to be plugged into xbox one at all times for it to function privacy advocates argued that kinect sensor data could be used for targeted advertising and to perform unauthorized surveillance on users in response to these claims microsoft reiterated that kinect voice recognition and motion tracking can be disabled by users that kinect data cannot be used for advertising per its privacy policy and that the console would not redistribute usergenerated content without permission in 2015 four members of an international hacking group pleaded guilty to gaining unauthorized access to microsofts computer network and obtaining sensitive information relating to xbox one and xbox live on june 13 2016 during its e3 2016 press conference microsoft unveiled xbox one s a revision of the original xbox one hardware with a streamlined form factor hardware design the xbox one s features a smaller casing and other design changes over the original model the original xbox ones exterior casing consists of a twotone liquid black finish with half finished in a matte grey and the other in a glossier black the matte side of the top of the console consists of a large air vent the design was intended to evoke a more entertainmentoriented and simplified look than previous iterations of the console among other changes the led rings used by xbox 360 are replaced by a glowing white xbox logo used to communicate the systems status to the user xbox one s utilizes a refreshed version of this design with a case that is 40 smaller in size and supports vertical orientation with a stand the main xbox one s sku is colored in an entirely matte robot white finish with half of the console adorned with machined holes and a visible circular vent on top of the consoles right half it utilizes pushbutton controls rather than capacitive keys

the xbox one does not support 1080i and other interlaced resolutions xbox one supports hdmi 14 for both input and output and does not support composite or component video xbox one s additionally supports 2160p 4k resolution video output and high dynamic range hdr color using hdr10 with a future update to add dolby vision hdr support for streaming video the console can monitor its internal temperature and adjust accordingly to prevent overheating alongside increasing fan speed additional measures can be taken including forcing the hardware to run in a lower power statea feature that was not present on xbox 360 restricting power consumption lowers maximum performance but the setting would be intended as a last resort to prevent permanent hardware damage controller xbox one elite controller featuring two unique pairs of analog sticks a new dpad and two differently sized pairs of paddles the xbox ones controller maintains the overall layout found in the xbox 360s controller but with various refinements to its form among its changes include a smoother form textured analog sticks a fourway directional pad and redesigned triggers and shoulder buttons with a curved shape for

features an hdmi input that can be used as a passthrough for tv settop boxes the xbox one can view and play content from dlna servers and usb storage devices using the media player app the console provides the ability to feed live television by serving as an hdmi passthrough for an existing television providers settop box or an optional digital tv tuner accessory that allows use of digital terrestrial television the xbox one does not provide full dvr functionality for recording television programs executive yusuf mehdi indicated that the console would work in tandem with existing television services but that microsoft would need to work with them directly to provide extended functionality such as dvr integration xbox live xbox live the xbox live service has been scaled up to use 300000 servers for xbox one users players can use the upload studio app to edit and share clips from the last five minutes of gameplay footage that is automatically recorded by the console as with

developers launch unfinished games for consumers to purchase and beta test before its official launch backward compatibility see also xbox one system software backward compatibility and list of backward compatible games for xbox one the xbox one achieves backward compatibility with select xbox 360 games through software emulation xbox 360 compatibility absolutely you can certainly plug an xbox 360 in the back that was one of my first questions when i heard about the feature larry hryb xbox live director of programming at its launch the xbox one did not have native backward compatibility with original xbox or xbox 360 games following the release of the xbox one and transition of phil spencer to the head of the xbox division in 2014 he and software engineering vice president kareem choudhry restarted the backwards compatibility program in relative secret within the company choudhry brought on previous engineers that worked on trioxide including kevin la chapelle jonathan morrison and barry bond to restart the program the team chose to start with castle crashers which included xbox networking features to test backwards compatibility xbox 360 backward compatibility uses a fission a software emulator within the system software 104 xbox 360 titles were supported at the features public launch with more added in the following months original xbox compatibility the first xbox videogame revealed to be compatible with the xbox one was crimson skies high road to revenge xbox division head phil spencer had also hinted the possibility of adding support for games from the original xbox with perreaults success microsoft announced the xbox backwards compatibility on the xbox one in june 2017 microsoft does not anticipate that there will be as many xbox titles brought to the program as with the xbox 360 primarily due to legal issues related to intellectual property contracts and companies that have since gone defunct reception prerelease while the initial unveiling of the xbox one in may 2013 created criticism that led to significant changes in the digital rights management scheme it would use other features of the console were highlighted by journalists the editorial staff of game informer offered both praise and criticism for the console matt helgeson described the console as microsofts intent to control the living room he called xbox ones instant switching features impressive and that the console was a step in the right direction with regards to tv entertainment especially the prospect of avoiding the usage of nonintuitive user interfaces often found on cable settop boxes jeff cork said that microsoft had some great ideas for the console but that it failed to properly communicate them microsofts e3 2013 press conference was criticized for focusing too much on games that beyond increased graphical capabilities provided experiences that were otherwise similar to previousgeneration gamesgiving little incentive for buying the new console critical reception upon its release the xbox one received favorable reviews from critics and reviewers in its launch review polygon gave the xbox one an 810 its design was described as inoffensive but its larger size noted while the consoles quieter and cooler operation was praised for indicating a potentially higher reliability than xbox 360 was onlaunch the controller was praised for its battery life and premium design but some members of the sites staff felt that its shoulder buttons were stiffer than that of previous designs the design of xbox ones interface received mixed reviews noting that it carried over windows 8s design language the interface was disfavored for hiding functions under the controllers menu button and for being awkward to use with a controller or motion gestures seemingly encouraging users to use voice navigation instead while praised for having more robust voice navigation than xbox 360 they felt that voice navigation still had a learning curve in understanding what works and what doesnt although its user following smart match and improved voice chat features were noted xbox live was panned for not offering the option onlaunch to add a real name to user profiles despite a regression in local and network multimedia functionality in comparison to xbox 360 and how oneguide interacted with outside settop boxes drawing comparisons to the operations of tivo dvrs polygon felt the xbox ones overall multimedia experience feels like a major step forward in settop boxes and makes the xbox one the obvious center of any living room that has one ben gilbert of engadget was similarly modest upon its launch assigning the console a score of 81100 and describing the xbox ones design as a 1993 artists rendering of 2013s technology acknowledging that its controller was a mere refinement of the ubiquit later on critics felt that the xbox ones functionality had matured over the year following its launch jeff bakalar of cnet assigning it a score of 810 acknowledged improvements to xbox ones software since its original release but that its user interface was still unintuitive in comparison to xbox 360 and playstation 4 explaining that navigating the interface seems to be much more problematic than it rightfully should be and theres simply not enough transparency in the logic within it there are oddities peppered throughout which is the root for countless headaches and frustrations xbox ones ingame performance was mixed with some titles showing slower performance over ps4 but some multiplatform games performing better on xbox one than ps4 cnet praised the wider lineup of multimedia services and apps on xbox one over ps4 not requiring xbox live gold for online save data storage support for highspeed usb 30 as secondary storage and having a slightly better lineup of upcoming exclusives concluding that while the ps4 had a clear advantage at launch that edge is slowly evaporating as microsoft has worked feverishly to undo most of the xbox ones original missteps nick pino of techradar giving it four stars out of five similarly felt that the xbox one alaina yee of ign also praised how xbox one had evolved since its launch assigning it with kinect a score of 8110 and acknowledging that microsoft had made good on its promise of listening to consumers rolling out a steady stream of updates that have both broadened and deepened what this third xbox console offers regarding the consoles slightly lower level of graphics capabilities in comparison to playstation 4 it was noted that while videophiles might spot instances of upscaled graphics and less detailed environments immediately most people generally wont notice a difference between xbox one and playstation 4 versions of a game when there is one unless they see both running side by side and examples of gorgeous xbox one games were noted such as sunset overdrive and forza motorsport 5 the number of hidden options in xbox ones user interface was equated to hunting for treasure in a messy room as such kinect voice commands in combination with access to common functions within the xbox smartglass app were praised for helping to provide a more streamlined user experience the xbox one s revision was critically praised for its improvements over the original model including its streamlined design the addition of hdr and 4k video support and visual improvements on some games such as fallout 4 and rise of the tomb raider when upscaled to 4k however techradar noted regressions such as the lack of a kinect port considered one last kick in the pants for all the gamers forced into buying the more expensive console bundle two short years ago and concerns that the revised hardware and hdr support would lead to fragmentation of xbox ones ecosystem as not all users will necessarily experience a game the same way dieter bohn of the verge similarly felt that although it was one of the cheapest 4k bluray players on the market consumers were more interested in streaming 4k content which could be accomplished with cheaper digital media players than 4k bluray discs and noted the small number of hdrenabled games on launch bohn concluded that the xbox one s would appeal best to new owners or those who wish to leverage its hdr and 4k support but recommended that existing owners consider xbox one x instead lack of exclusive titles the xbox one platform has faced criticism for lacking in exclusive releases over competitors such as playstation 4 and nintendo switch although there have been releases in flagship microsoft franchises such as forza and halo they have underperformed in comparison to other entries while several major xbox one exclusives have faced notable delays such as crackdown 3 or outright cancellations including fable legends and scalebound microsoft initially imposed policies referred to as the parity clause on indie games which required that the xbox one version of a game be released at the same time as versions on other platforms phil spencer stated that this rule was intended to ensure that xbox one was a firstclass platform by discouraging staggered releases however these policies resulted in some studios such as vlambeer developer of nuclear throne choosing to negotiate console exclusivity with sony instead who proved to be more receptive to indie development by july 2015 microsoft had changed its policies in response to the criticism with spencer admitting that this policy was onerous on smaller studios spencer also stated that microsoft was willing to work with studios to help make the xbox launches of former timed exclusives special in some way so that customers are not simply purchasing last years game an analyst also noted that microsofts firstparty studios were not as strong as those of sony explaining that sony has always been about first party and microsoft wanted to emulate that but they allowed studios like rare and lionhead to fade away some xbox one titles such as playerunknowns battlegrounds are being marketed as a console launch exclusive meaning that they had or will be available on pc but their console releases would be a timed or permanent exclusive to xbox hardware sales microsoft only publicized its sales figures during the first year after release the last official figure was released in november 2014 with the company announcing in october 2015 that it would no longer publish sales figures for the system on november 22 2013 microsoft confirmed that it had sold one million xbox one consoles within its first 24 hours of being available on december 11 2013 microsoft announced that it had sold approximately 2 million units in its first 18 days on sale on january 6 2014 microsoft announced that approximately 3 million consoles had been sold worldwide in 2013 with microsofts october 2015 announcement that it would no longer publish sales figures for the system the 10 million figure from november 2014 is still the latest official cumulative sales number the xbox one has sold poorly in japan continuing the trend of microsofts previous consoles which have struggled against the local sony and nintendo the xbox one sold a total figure of 23562 consoles within its launch week by comparison the xbox 360 sold 62000 consoles in japan during its opening week in 2005 in

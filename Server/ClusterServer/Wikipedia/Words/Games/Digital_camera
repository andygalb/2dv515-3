hasselblad 503cw with ixpress v96c digital back an example of a professional digital camera system nikon d810 a digital camera or digicam is a camera that captures photographs in digital memory most cameras produced today are digital however highend highdefinition dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals digital and movie cameras share an optical system typically using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup device the diaphragm and shutter admit the correct amount of light to the imager just as with film but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical however unlike film cameras digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded and store and delete images from memory many digital cameras can also record moving videos with sound some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other elementary image editing history further information history of the camera digital cameras digital singlelens reflex camera and camera phone the history of the digital camera began with eugene f lally of the jet propulsion laboratory who was thinking about how to use a mosaic photosensor to capture digital images his 1961 idea was to take pictures of the planets and stars while travelling through space to give information about the astronauts position as with texas instruments employee willis adcocks filmless camera us patent 4057830 in 1972 the technology had yet to catch up with the concept the cromemco cyclops was an alldigital camera introduced as a commercial product in 1975 its design was published as a hobbyist construction project in the february 1975 issue of popular electronics magazine and it used a 3232 metal oxide semiconductor sensor steven sasson an engineer at eastman kodak invented and built the first selfcontained electronic camera that used a chargecoupled device image sensor in 1975 in 1986 japanese company nikon introduced the first digital singlelens reflex dslr camera the nikon svc in 2000 sharp introduced the worlds first digital camera phone the jsh04 jphone in japan by the mid2000s higherend cell phones had an integrated digital camera by the beginning of the 2010s almost all smartphones had an integrated digital camera image sensors further information image sensor the two major types of digital image sensor are ccd and cmos a ccd sensor has one amplifier for all the pixels while each pixel in a cmos activepixel sensor has its own amplifier sensor resolution the resolution of a digital camera is often limited by the image sensor that turns light into discrete signals the brighter the image at a given point on the sensor the larger the value that is read for that pixel depending on the physical structure of the sensor a color filter array may be used which requires demosaicing to recreate a fullcolor image the number of pixels in the sensor determines the cameras pixel count in a typical sensor the pixel count is the product of the number of rows and the number of columns for example a 1000 by 1000 pixel sensor would have 1000000 pixels or 1 megapixel image sharpness final quality of an image depends on all optical transformations in the chain of producing the image carl zeiss points out that the weakest link in an optical chain determines the final image quality in case of a digital camera a simplistic way of expressing it is that the lens determines the maximum sharpness of the image while the image sensor determines the maximum resolution the illustration on the right can be said to compare a lens with very poor sharpness on a camera with high resolution to a lens with good sharpness on a camera with lower resolution methods of image capture at the heart of a digital camera is a ccd or a cmos image sensor digital camera partly disassembled the lens assembly bottom right is partially removed but the sensor top right still captures an image as seen on the lcd screen bottom left since the first digital backs were introduced there have been three main methods of capturing the image each based on the hardware configuration of the sensor and color filters singleshot capture systems use either one sensor chip with a bayer filter mosaic or three separate image sensors one each for the primary additive colors red green and blue which are exposed to the same image via a beam splitter see threeccd camera multishot exposes the sensor to the image in a sequence of three or more openings of the lens aperture there are several methods of application of the multishot technique the most common originally was to use a single image sensor with three filters passed in front of the sensor in sequence to obtain the additive color information another multiple shot method is called microscanning this method uses a single sensor chip with a bayer filter and physically moved the sensor on the focus plane of the lens to construct a higher resolution image than the native resolution of the chip a third version combined the two methods without a bayer filter on the chip the third method is called scanning because the sensor moves across the focal plane much like the sensor of an image scanner the linear or trilinear sensors in scanning cameras utilize only a single line of photosensors or three lines for the three colors scanning may be accomplished by moving the sensor for example when using color cosite sampling or by rotating the whole camera a digital rotating line camera offers images of very high total resolution the choice of method for a given capture is determined largely by the subject matter it is usually inappropriate to attempt to capture a subject that moves with anything but a singleshot system however the higher color fidelity and larger file sizes and resolutions available with multishot and scanning backs make them attractive for commercial photographers working with stationary subjects and largeformat photographs improvements in singleshot cameras and image file processing at the beginning of the 21st century made single shot cameras almost completely dominant even in highend commercial photography filter mosaics interpolation and aliasing the bayer arrangement of color filters on the pixel array of an image sensor most current consumer digital cameras use a bayer filter mosaic in combination with an optical antialiasing filter to reduce the aliasing due to the reduced sampling of the different primarycolor images a demosaicing algorithm is used to interpolate color information to create a full array of rgb image data cameras that use a beamsplitter singleshot 3ccd approach threefilter multishot approach color cosite sampling or foveon x3 sensor do not use antialiasing filters nor demosaicing firmware in the camera or a software in a raw converter program such as adobe camera raw interprets the raw data from the sensor to obtain a full color image because the rgb color model requires three intensity values for each pixel one each for the red green and blue other color models when used also require three or more values per pixel a single sensor element cannot simultaneously record these three intensities and so a color filter array cfa must be used to selectively filter a particular color for each pixel the bayer filter pattern is a repeating 2x2 mosaic pattern of light filters with green ones at opposite corners and red and blue in the other two positions the high proportion of green takes advantage of properties of the human visual system which determines brightness mostly from green and is far more sensitive to brightness than to hue or saturation sometimes a 4color filter pattern is used often involving two different hues of green this provides potentially more accurate color but requires a slightly more complicated interpolation process the color intensity values not captured for each pixel can be interpolated from the values of adjacent pixels which represent the color being calculated sensor size and angle of view cameras with digital image sensors that are smaller than the typical 35mm film size have a smaller field or angle of view when used with a lens of the same focal length this is because angle of view is a function of both focal length and the sensor or film size used the crop factor is relative to the 35mm film format if a smaller sensor is used as in most digicams the field of view is cropped by the sensor to smaller than the 35mm fullframe formats field of view this narrowing of the field of view may be described as crop factor a factor by which a longer focal length lens would be needed to get the same field of view on a 35mm film camera fullframe digital slrs utilize a sensor of the same size as a frame of 35mm film common values for field of view crop in dslrs using active pixel sensors include 13x for some canon apsh sensors 15x for sony apsc sensors used by nikon pentax and konica minolta and for fujifilm sensors 16 apsc for most canon sensors 17x for sigmas foveon sensors and 2x for kodak and panasonic 43inch sensors currently used by olympus and panasonic crop factors for nonslr consumer compact and bridge cameras are larger frequently 4x or more further information image sensor format relative sizes of sensors used in most current digital cameras table of sensor sizes type width mm height mm size mm 136 400 300

multispectral imaging equipment and astrographs are used for scientific military medical and other special purposes compacts subcompact with lens assembly retracted disassembled compact digital camera compact cameras are intended to be portable pocketable and are particularly suitable for casual snapshots many incorporate a retractable lens assembly that provides optical zoom in most models an auto actuating lens cover protects the lens from elements most ruggedized or waterresistant models do not retract and most with superzoom capability do not retract fully compact cameras are usually designed to be easy to use almost all include an automatic mode or auto mode which automatically makes all camera settings for the user some also have manual controls compact digital cameras typically contain a small sensor which tradesoff picture quality for compactness and simplicity images can usually only be stored using lossy compression jpeg most have a builtin flash usually of low power sufficient for nearby subjects a few high end compact digital cameras have a hotshoe for connecting to an external flash live preview is almost always used to frame the photo on an integrated lcd in addition to being able to take still photographs almost all compact cameras have the ability to record video compacts often have macro capability and zoom lenses but the zoom range up to 30x is generally enough for candid photography but less than is available on bridge cameras more than 60x or the interchangeable lenses of dslr cameras available at a much higher cost autofocus systems in compact digital cameras generally are based on a contrastdetection methodology using the image data from the live preview feed of the main imager some compact digital cameras use a hybrid autofocus system similar to what is commonly available on dslrs typically compact digital cameras incorporate a nearly silent leaf shutter into the lens but play a simulated camera sound for skeuomorphic purposes for low cost and small size these cameras typically use image sensor formats with a diagonal between 6 and 11mm corresponding to a crop factor between 7 and 4 this gives them weaker lowlight performance greater depth of field generally closer focusing ability and smaller components than cameras using larger sensors some cameras use a larger sensor including at the high end a pricey fullframe sensor compact camera such as sony cybershot dscrx1 but have capability near that of a dslr a variety of additional features are available depending on the model of the camera such features include gps compass barometers and altimeters starting in 2011 some compact digital cameras can take 3d still photos these 3d compact stereo cameras can capture 3d panoramic photos with dual lens or even single lens for play back on a 3d tv in 2013 sony released two addon camera models without display to be used with a smartphone or tablet controlled by a mobile application via wifi rugged compacts rugged compact cameras typically include protection against submersion hot and cold conditions shock and pressure terms used to describe such properties include waterproof freezeproof heatproof shockproof and crushproof respectively nearly all major camera manufacturers have at least one product in this category some are waterproof to a considerable depth up to 82 feet 27 m others only 10 feet 3m but only a few will float ruggeds often lack some of the features of ordinary compact camera but they have video capability and the majority can record sound most have image stabilization and builtin flash touchscreen lcd and gps do not work under water action cameras further information action camera gopro and other brands offer action cameras which are rugged small and can be easily attached to helmet arm bicycle etc most have wide angle and fixed focus and can take still pictures and video typically with sound the rising popularity of action cameras is in line with many people desiring to share photos or videos in social media many competitive manufacturers of action cameras results in many options and lowered competitive prices and nowadays cameras are sold bundled with waterproof housings accessories and mountings compatible with the popular gopro 360degree cameras the 360degree camera can take picture or video 360 degrees using two lenses backtoback and shooting at the same time some of the cameras are ricoh theta s nikon keymission 360 and samsung gear 360 nico360 was launched in 2016 and claimed as the worlds smallest 360degree camera with size 46 x 46 x 28mm 18 x 18 x 11 in and price less than 200 with virtual reality mode builtin stitching wifi and bluetooth live streaming can be done due to it also being water resistant the nico360 can be used as action camera there are tend that action cameras have capabilities to shoot 360 degrees with at least 4k resolution bridge cameras sony dsch2 bridge camera bridge cameras physically resemble dslrs and are sometimes called dslrshape or dslrlike they provide some similar features but like compacts they use a fixed lens and a small sensor some compact cameras have also psam mode most use live preview to frame the image their usual autofocus is by the same contrastdetect mechanism as compacts but many bridge cameras have a manual focus mode and some have a separate focus ring for greater control big physical size and small sensor allow superzoom and wide aperture bridge cameras generally include an image stabilization system to enable longer handheld exposures sometimes better than dslr for low light condition as of 2014 bridge cameras come in two principal classes in terms of sensor size firstly the more traditional 123 sensor as measured by image sensor format which gives more flexibility in lens design and allows for handholdable zoom from 20 to 24mm 35mm equivalent wide angle all the way up to over 1000mm supertele and secondly a 1 sensor that allows better image quality particularly in low light higher iso but puts greater constraints on lens design resulting in zoom lenses that stop at 200mm constant aperture eg sony rx10 or 400mm variable aperture eg panasonic lumix fz1000 equivalent corresponding to an optical zoom factor of roughly 10 to 15 some bridge cameras have a lens thread to attach accessories such as wideangle or telephoto converters as well as filters such as uv or circular polarizing filter and lens hoods the scene is composed by viewing the display or the electronic viewfinder evf most have a slightly longer shutter lag than a dslr many of these cameras can store images in a raw format in addition to supporting jpeg the majority have a builtin flash but only a few have a hotshoe in bright sun the quality difference between a good compact camera and a digital slr is minimal but bridge cameras are more portable cost less and have a greater zoom ability thus a bridge camera may better suit outdoor daytime activities except when seeking professionalquality photos mirrorless interchangeablelens cameras olympus omd em1 mark ii introduced 2016 nikon z7 introduced 2018 mirrorless interchangeablelens camera in late 2008 a new type of camera emerged called mirrorless interchangeablelens camera milc which uses various sensors and offers lens interchangeability these are simpler and more compact than dslrs due to not having a lens reflex system milc camera models are available with various sensor sizes including a small 123inch sensor as is commonly used in bridge cameras such as the original pentax q more recent pentax q versions have a slightly larger 117inch sensor a 1inch sensor a micro four thirds sensor an apsc sensor such as the sony nex series fujifilm x series pentax k01 and canon eos m and some such as the sony 7 use a full frame 35mm sensor and even hasselblad x1d is the first medium format milc some milc cameras have a separate electronic viewfinder in other cameras the back display is used as a viewfinder in same way as in compact cameras a disadvantage of milc compared to dslr is battery life due to the energy consumption of the electronic viewfinder olympus and panasonic released many micro four thirds cameras with interchangeable lenses which are fully compatible each other without any adapter while the others have proprietary mounts in 2014 kodak released its first micro four third system camera as of march2014 modular cameras while most digital cameras with interchangeable lenses feature a lensmount of some kind there are also a number of modular cameras where the shutter and sensor are incorporated into the lens module the first such modular camera was the minolta dimge v in 1996 followed by the minolta dimge ex 1500 in 1998 and the minolta metaflash 3d 1500 in 1999 in 2009 ricoh released the ricoh gxr modular camera at ces 2013 sakar international announced the polaroid im1836 an 18 mp camera with 1sensor with interchangeable sensorlens an adapter for micro four thirds nikon and kmount lenses was planned to ship with the camera there are also a number of addon camera modules for smartphones called lensstyle cameras lens camera they contain all components of a digital camera in a module but lack a viewfinder display and most of the controls instead they can be mounted to a smartphone and use its display and controls lensstyle cameras include sony smartshot qx series announced and released in mid 2013 in january 2014 announced a firmware update for cybershot smartshot dscqx10 and dscqx100 the latter with emount instead of a builtin lens kodak pixpro smart lens camera series announced in 2014 vivicam smart lens camera series from vivitarsakar announced in 2014 olympus air lens camera announced in 2014 and released in 2015 the lens camera is open platform using android operating system and can detach into 2 parts sensor part and lens part and all micro four thirds system lenses can be attached to sensor part of the lens camera digital singlelens reflex cameras cutaway of an olympus e30 dslr digital singlelens reflex camera digital singlelens reflex cameras dslr use a reflex mirror that can reflect the light and also can swivel from one position to another position and back to initial position by default the reflex mirror is set 45 degree from horizontal blocks the light to the sensor and reflects light from the lens to pentamirrorprism at the dslr camera and after some reflections arrives at the viewfinder the reflex mirror is pulled out horizontally below the pentamirrorprism when shutter release is fully pressed so the viewfinder will be dark and the lightimage can directly strike the sensor at the time of exposure speed setting autofocus is accomplished using sensors in the mirror box some dslrs have a live view mode that allows framing using the screen with image from the sensor these cameras have much larger sensors than the other types typically 18mm to 36mm on the diagonal crop factor 2 16 or 1 the larger sensor permits more light to be received by each pixel this combined with the relatively large lenses provides superior lowlight performance for the same field of view and the same aperture a larger sensor gives shallower focus they use interchangeable lenses for versatility usually some lenses are made for digital slr use only but recent trend the lenses can also be used in detachable lens video camera with or without adapter digital single lens translucent dslt cameras sony slt camera a dslt uses a fixed translucent mirror instead of a moving reflex mirror as in dslr a translucent mirror or transmissive mirror or semitransparent mirror is a mirror which reflects the light to two things at the same time it reflects it along the path to a pentaprismpentamirror which then goes to an optical view finder ovf as is done with a reflex mirror in dslr cameras the translucent mirror also sends light along a second path to the sensor the total amount of light is not changed just some of the light travels one path and some of it travels the other the consequences are that dslt cameras should shoot a half stop differently from dsl one advantage of using a dslt camera is the blind moments a dslr user experiences while the reflecting mirror is moved to send the light to the sensor instead of the viewfinder do not exist for dslt cameras because there is no time at which light is not traveling along both paths dslt cameras get the benefit of continuous autofocus tracking this is especially beneficial for burst mode shooting in lowlight conditions and also for tracking when taking video until early 2014 only sony had released dslt cameras by march 2013 sony had released more dslts than dslrs with a relatively complete lenses lineup digital rangefinders rangefinder camera digital rangefinder a rangefinder is a device to measure subject distance with the intent to adjust the focus of a cameras objective lens accordingly openloop controller the rangefinder and lens focusing mechanism may or may not be coupled in common parlance the term rangefinder camera is interpreted very narrowly to denote manualfocus cameras with a visuallyread out optical rangefinder based on parallax most digital cameras achieve focus through analysis of the image captured by the objective lens and distance estimation if it is provided at all is only a byproduct of the focusing process closedloop controller linescan camera systems a san francisco cable car imaged using an alkeria necta n4k27c line scan camera with a shutter speed of 250 microseconds or 4000 frames per second a linescan camera traditionally has a single row of pixel sensors instead of a matrix of them the lines are continuously fed to a computer that joins them to each other and makes an image this is most commonly done by connecting the camera output to a frame grabber which resides in a pci slot of an industrial computer the frame grabber acts to buffer the image and sometimes provide some processing before delivering to the computer software for processing multiple rows of sensors may be used to make colored images or to increase sensitivity by tdi time delay and integration many industrial applications require a wide field of view traditionally maintaining consistent light over large 2d areas is quite difficult with a line scan camera all that is necessary is to provide even illumination across the line currently being viewed by the camera this makes possible sharp pictures of objects that pass the camera at high speed such cameras are also commonly used to make photo finishes to determine the winner when multiple competitors cross the finishing line at nearly the same time they can also be used as industrial instruments for analyzing fast processes linescan cameras are also extensively used in imaging from satellites see push broom scanner in this case the row of sensors is perpendicular to the direction of satellite motion linescan cameras are widely

or standard lens with fixed focus it can have a microphone and speaker and it can take photos and video as a remote camera a phone app using android or ios is needed to send live video change settings take photos or use time lapse integration into other devices many devices have a builtin digital camera including for example smartphones mobile phones pdas and laptop computers builtin cameras generally store the images in the jpeg file format mobile phones incorporating digital cameras were introduced in japan in 2001 by jphone in 2003 camera phones outsold standalone digital cameras and in 2006 they outsold film and digital standalone cameras five billion camera phones were sold in five years and by 2007 more than half of the installed base of all mobile phones were camera phones sales of separate cameras peaked in 2008 market trends sale of smartphones compared to digital cameras 20092013 sales of traditional digital cameras have declined due to the increasing use of smartphones for casual photography which also enable easier manipulation and sharing of photos through the use of apps and webbased services bridge cameras in contrast have held their ground with functionality that most smartphone cameras lack such as optical zoom and other advanced features in response to the convenience and flexibility of smartphone cameras some manufacturers produced smart digital cameras that combine features of traditional cameras with those of a smartphone in 2012 nikon and samsung released the coolpix s800c and galaxy camera the first two digital cameras to run the android operating system since this software platform is used in many smartphones they can integrate with services such as email attachments social networks and photo sharing sites as smartphones do and use other androidcompatible software as well in an inversion some phone makers have introduced smartphones with cameras designed to resemble traditional digital cameras nokia released the 808 pureview and lumia 1020 in 2012 and 2013 the two devices respectively run the symbian and windows phone operating systems and both include a 41megapixel camera along with a camera grip attachment for the latter lightfield cameras were introduced in 2013 with one consumer product and several professional ones after a big dip of sales in 2012 consumer digital camera sales declined again in 2013 by 36 percent in 2011 compact digital cameras sold 10 million per month in 2013 sales fell to about 4 million per month dslr and milc sales also declined in 2013 by 1015 after almost ten years of double digit growth worldwide unit sales of digital cameras is continuously declining from 148 million in 2011 to 58 million in 2015 and tends to decrease more in the following years film camera sold got the peak at 36671 million units in 1997 and digital camera sold began in 1999 in 2008 film camera market was dead and digital camera sold got the peak by 121463 million units in 2010 in 2002 cell phone with camera has been introduced and in 2003 the cell phone with camera sold 80 million units per year in 2011 the cell phone with camera sold hundreds of millions per year when digital camera sold initialized to decline in 2015 digital camera sold is 35395 million units or only less than a third of digital camera sold number in a peak and also slightly less than film camera sold number in a peak connectivity transferring photos many digital cameras can connect directly to a computer to transfer data early cameras used the pc serial port usb is now the most widely used method most cameras are viewable as usb mass storage though some have a firewire port some cameras use usb ptp mode for connection instead of usb msc some offer both modes other cameras use wireless connections via bluetooth or ieee 80211 wifi such as the kodak easyshare one wifi integrated memory cards sdhc sdxc can transmit stored images video and other files to computers or smartphones mobile operating systems such as android allow automatic upload and backup or sharing of images over wifi to photo sharing and cloud services cameras with integrated wifi or specific wifi adapters mostly allow camera control especially shutter release exposure control and more tethering from computer or smartphone apps additionally to the transfer of media data cameraphones and some highend standalone digital cameras also use cellular networks to connect for sharing images the most common standard on cellular networks is the mms multimedia messaging service commonly called picture messaging the second method with smartphones is to send a picture as an email attachment many old cameraphones however do not support email a common alternative is the use of a card reader which may be capable of reading several types of storage media as well as high speed transfer of data to the computer use of a card reader also avoids draining the camera battery during the download process an external card reader allows convenient direct access to the images on a collection of storage media but if only one storage card is in use moving it back and forth between the camera and the reader can be inconvenient many computers have a card reader built in at least for sd cards printing photos many modern cameras support the pictbridge standard which allows them to send data directly to a pictbridgecapable computer printer without the need for a computer wireless connectivity can also provide for printing photos without a cable connection an instantprint camera is a digital camera with a builtin printer displaying photos many digital cameras include a video output port usually svideo it sends a standarddefinition video signal to a television allowing the user to show one picture at a time buttons or menus on the camera allow the user to select the photo advance from one to another or automatically send a slide show to the tv hdmi has been adopted by many highend digital camera makers to show photos in their highresolution quality on an hdtv in january 2008 silicon image announced a new technology for sending video from mobile devices to a television in digital form mhl sends pictures as a video stream up to 1080p resolution and is compatible with hdmi some dvd recorders and television sets can read memory cards used in cameras alternatively several types of flash card readers have tv output capability weathersealing and waterproofing cameras can be equipped with a varying amount of environmental sealing to provide protection against splashing water moisture humidity and fog dust and sand or complete waterproofness to a certain depth and for a certain duration the latter is one of the approaches to allow underwater photography the other approach being the use of waterproof housings many waterproof digital cameras are also shockproof and resistant to low temperatures some waterproof cameras can be fitted with a waterproof housing to increase the operational depth range the olympus tough range of compact cameras is an example modes many digital cameras have preset modes for different applications within the constraints of correct exposure various parameters can be changed including exposure aperture focusing light metering white balance and equivalent sensitivity for example a portrait might use a wider aperture to render the background out of focus and would seek out and focus on a human face rather than other image content image data storage a compactflash cf card one of many media types used to store digital photographs many camera phones and most stand alone digital cameras store image data in flash memory cards or other removable media most standalone cameras use sd format while a few use compactflash or other types in january 2012 a faster xqd card format was announced in early 2014 some high end cameras have two hotswapable memory slots photographers can swap one of the memory card with cameraon each memory slot can accept either compact flash or sd card all new sony cameras also have two memory slots one for its memory stick and one for sd card but not hotswapable a few cameras used other removable storage such as microdrives very small hard disk drives cd single 185mb and 35 floppy disks other unusual formats include onboard flash memory cheap cameras and cameras secondary to the devices main use such as a camera phone pc card hard drives early professional cameras discontinued thermal printer known only in one model of camera that printed images immediately rather than storing mini cd microdrive cfii usb flash drive 35 floppy disks sonys memory stick most manufacturers of digital cameras do not provide drivers and software to allow their cameras to work with linux or other free software still many cameras use the standard usb storage protocol and are thus easily usable other cameras are supported by the gphoto project file formats image file formats the joint photography experts group standard jpeg is the most common file format for storing image data other file types include tagged image file format tiff and various raw image formats many cameras especially highend ones support a raw image format a raw image is the unprocessed set of pixel data directly from the cameras sensor often saved in a proprietary format adobe systems has released the dng format a royaltyfree raw image format used by at least 10 camera manufacturers raw files initially had to be processed in specialized image editing programs but over time many mainstream editing programs such as googles picasa have added support for raw images rendering to standard images from raw sensor data allows more flexibility in making major adjustments without losing image quality or retaking the picture formats for movies are avi dv mpeg mov often containing motion jpeg wmv and asf basically the same as wmv recent formats include mp4 which is based on the quicktime format and uses newer compression algorithms to allow longer recording times in the same space other formats that are used in cameras but not for pictures are the design rule for camera format dcf an iso specification used in almost all camera since 1998 which defines an internal file structure and naming also used is the digital print order format dpof which dictates what order images are to be printed in and how many copies the dcf 1998 defines a logical file system with 83 filenames and makes the usage of either fat12 fat16 fat32 or exfat mandatory for its physical layer in order to maximize platform interoperability most cameras include exif data that provides metadata about the picture exif data may include aperture exposure time focal length date and time taken and location batteries digital cameras have become smaller over time resulting in an ongoing need to develop a battery small enough to fit in the camera and yet able to power it for a reasonable length of time digital cameras utilize either proprietary or standard consumer batteries as of march 2014 most cameras use proprietary lithiumion batteries while some use standard aa batteries or primarily use a proprietary lithiumion rechargeable battery pack but have an optional aa battery holder available proprietary the most common class of battery used in digital cameras is proprietary battery formats these are built to a manufacturers custom specifications almost all proprietary batteries are lithiumion in addition to being available from the oem aftermarket replacement batteries are commonly available for most camera models standard consumer batteries commercial offtheshelf digital cameras that utilize offtheshelf batteries are typically designed to be able to use both singleuse disposable and rechargeable batteries but not with both types in use at the same time the most common offtheshelf battery size used is aa cr2 crv3 batteries and aaa batteries are also used in some cameras the cr2 and crv3 batteries are lithium based intended for a single use rechargeable rcrv3 lithiumion batteries are also available as an alternative to nonrechargeable crv3 batteries some battery grips for dslrs come with a separate holder to accommodate aa cells as an external power source conversion of film cameras to digital digital singlelens reflex camera when digital cameras became common many photographers asked whether their film cameras could be converted to digital the answer was yes and no for the majority of 35mm film cameras the answer is no the reworking and cost would be too great especially as lenses have been evolving as well as cameras for most a conversion to digital to give enough space for the electronics and allow a liquid crystal display to preview would require removing the back of the camera and replacing it with a custom built digital unit many early professional slr cameras such as the kodak dcs series were developed from 35mm film cameras the technology of the time however meant that rather than being digital backs the bodies of these cameras were mounted on large bulky digital units often bigger than the camera portion itself these were factory built cameras however not aftermarket conversions a notable exception is the nikon e2 and nikon e3 using additional optics to convert the 35mm format to a 23 ccdsensor a few 35mm cameras have had digital camera backs made by their manufacturer leica being a notable example medium format and large format cameras those using film stock greater than 35mm have a low unit production and typical digital backs for them cost over 10000 these cameras also tend to be highly modular with handgrips film backs winders and lenses available separately to fit various needs the very large sensor these backs use leads to enormous image sizes for example phase ones p45 39mp image back creates a single tiff image of size up to 2246mb and even greater pixel counts are available medium format digitals such as this are geared more towards studio and portrait photography than their smaller dslr counterparts the iso speed in particular tends to have a maximum of 400 versus 6400 for some dslr cameras canon eos1d mark iv and nikon d3s have iso 12800 plus hi3 iso 102400 with the canon eos1dxs iso of 204800 digital camera backs digital camera back in the industrial and highend professional photography market some camera systems use modular removable image sensors for example some medium format slr cameras such as the mamiya 645d series allow installation of either a digital camera back or a traditional photographic film back area array ccd cmos linear array ccd monochrome 3strip ccd with color filters linear array cameras are also called scan backs singleshot multishot threeshot usually most earlier digital camera backs used linear array sensors moving vertically to digitize the image many of them only capture grayscale images the relatively long exposure times in the range of seconds or even minutes generally limit scan backs to studio applications where all aspects of the photographic scene are under the photographers control some other camera backs use ccd arrays similar to typical cameras these are called singleshot backs since it is much easier to manufacture a highquality linear ccd array with only thousands of pixels than a ccd matrix with millions very high resolution linear ccd camera backs were available much earlier than their ccd matrix counterparts for example you could buy an albeit expensive camera back with over 7000 pixel horizontal resolution in the mid1990s however as of 2004 to capture about 120000 lines during one full 360 degree rotation thereby creating a single digital image of 1200 megapixels most modern digital camera backs use ccd or cmos matrix sensors the matrix sensor captures the entire image frame at once instead of incrementing scanning the frame area through the prolonged exposure for example phase one produces a 39 million pixel digital camera back with a 491 x 368mm ccd in 2008 this ccd array is a little smaller than a frame of 120 film and much larger than a 35 mm frame 36 x 24mm in comparison consumer digital cameras use arrays ranging from 36 x 24mm full frame on high end consumer dslrs to 128 x

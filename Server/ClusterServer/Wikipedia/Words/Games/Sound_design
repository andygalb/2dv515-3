sound design sound design is the art and practice of creating sound tracks for a variety of needs it involves specifying acquiring or creating auditory elements using audio production techniques and tools it is employed in a variety of disciplines including filmmaking television production video game development theatre sound recording and reproduction live performance sound art postproduction radio and musical instrument development sound design commonly involves performing see eg foley and editing of previously composed or recorded audio such as sound effects and dialogue for the purposes of the medium a sound designer is one who practices sound design history karel dujardins commedia dellarte show 1657 see also prehistoric music the use of sound to evoke emotion reflect mood and underscore actions in plays and dances began in prehistoric times at its earliest it was used in religious practices for healing or recreation in ancient japan theatrical events called kagura were performed in shinto shrines with music and dance plays were performed in medieval times in a form of theatre called commedia dellarte which used music and sound effects to enhance performances the use of music and sound in the elizabethan theatre followed in which music and sound effects were produced off stage using devices such as bells whistles and horns cues would be written in the script for music and sound effects to be played at the appropriate time italian composer luigi russolo built mechanical soundmaking devices called intonarumori for futurist theatrical and music performances starting around 1913 these devices were meant to simulate natural and manmade sounds such as trains and bombs russolos treatise the art of noises is one of the earliest written documents on the use of abstract noise in the theatre after his death his intonarumori were used in more conventional theatre performances to create realistic sound effects recorded sound possibly the first use of recorded sound in the theatre was a phonograph playing a babys cry in a london theatre in 1890 over the course of the twentieth century the use of recorded sound effects began to take over from live sound effects though often it was the stage managers duty to find the sound effects and an electrician played the recordings during performances between 1980 and 1988 charlie richmond usitts first sound design commissioner oversaw efforts of their sound design commission to define the duties responsibilities standards and procedures which might normally be expected of a theatre sound designer in north america this subject is still regularly discussed by that group but during that time substantial conclusions were drawn and he wrote a document which although now somewhat dated provides a succinct record of what was expected at that time it was subsequently provided to both the adc and david goodman at the florida usa local when they were both planning to represent sound designers in the 1990s digital technology modern digital control room at tainted blue studios 2010 midi and digital audio technology have contributed to the evolution of sound production techniques in the 1980s and 1990s digital audio workstations and a variety of digital signal processing algorithms applied in them allow more complicated sound tracks with more tracks as well as auditory effects to be realized features such as unlimited undo and samplelevel editing allow fine control over the sound tracks in theatre sound features of computerized theatre sound design systems have also been recognized as being essential for live show control systems at walt disney world and as a result disney utilized systems of that type to control many facilities at their disneymgm studios theme park which opened in 1989 these features were incorporated into the midi show control msc specification an open communications protocol used to interact with diverse devices the first show to fully utilize the msc specification was the magic kingdom parade at walt disney worlds magic kingdom in september 1991 the rise of interest in game audio has also brought more advanced interactive audio tools that are also accessible without a background in computer programming some of such software tools termed implementation tools or audio engines feature a workflow thats similar to that in more conventional digital audio workstation programs and can also allow the sound production personnel to undertake some of the more creative interactive sound tasks that are considered to be part of sound design for computer applications that previously would have required a computer programmer interactive applications have also given rise to a plethora of techniques in dynamic audio that loosely means sound thats parametrically adjusted during the runtime of the program this allows for a broader expression in sounds more similar to that in films because this way the sound designer can eg create footstep sounds that vary in a believable and nonrepeating way and that also corresponds to whats seen in the picture the digital audio workstation cannot directly communicate with game engines because the games events occur often in an unpredictable order whereas traditional digital audio workstations as well as so called linear media tv film etc have everything occur in the same order every time the production is run especially games have also brought in dynamic or adaptive mixing the world wide web has greatly enhanced the ability of sound designers to acquire source material quickly easily and cheaply nowadays a designer can preview and download crisper more believable sounds as opposed to toiling through time and budgetdraining shotinthedark searches through record stores libraries and the grapevine for often inferior recordings in addition software innovation has enabled sound designers to take more of a diy or doityourself approach from the comfort of their home and at any hour they can simply use a computer speakers and headphones rather than renting or buying costly equipment or studio space and time for editing and mixing this provides for faster creation and negotiation with the director applications film see also sound editor filmmaking foley artist and director of audiography in motion picture production a sound editordesigner is a member of a film crew responsible for the entirety or some specific parts of a films sound track in the american film industry the title sound designer is not controlled by any professional organization unlike titles such as director or screenwriter the terms sound design and sound designer began to be used in the motion picture industry in 1969 at that time the title of sound designer was first granted to walter murch by francis ford coppola in recognition for murchs contributions to the film the rain people the term sound designer has replaced monikers like supervising sound editor or rerecording mixer for what was essentially the same position the head designer of the final sound track editors and mixers like murray spivack king kong george groves the jazz singer james g stewart citizen kane and carl faulkner journey to the center of the earth served in this capacity during hollywoods studio era and are generally considered to be sound designers by a different name the advantage of calling oneself a sound designer beginning in later decades was twofold it strategically allowed for a single person to work as both an editor and mixer on a film without running into issues pertaining to the jurisdictions of editors and mixers as outlined by their respective unions additionally it was a rhetorical move that legitimated the field of postproduction sound at a time when studios were downsizing their sound departments and when producers were routinely skimping on budgets and salaries for sound editors and mixers in so doing it allowed those who called themselves sound designers to compete for contract work and to negotiate higher salaries the position of sound designer therefore emerged in a manner similar to that of production designer which was created in the 1930s when william cameron menzies made revolutionary contributions to the craft of art direction in the making of gone with the wind the audio production team is a principal member of the production staff with creative output comparable to that of the film editor and director of photography several factors have led to the promotion of audio production to this level when previously it was considered subordinate to other parts of film cinema sound systems became capable of highfidelity reproduction particularly after the adoption of dolby stereo these systems were originally devised as gimmicks to increase theater attendance but their widespread implementation created a content vacuum that had to be filled by competent professionals before stereo soundtracks film sound was of such low fidelity that only the dialogue and occasional sound effects were practical the greater dynamic range of the new systems coupled with the ability to produce sounds at the sides or behind the audience provided the audio production team new opportunities for creative expression in film sound some directors were interested in realizing the new potentials of the medium a new generation of filmmakers the socalled easy riders and raging bullsmartin scorsese steven spielberg george lucas and otherswere aware of the creative potential of sound and wanted to use it filmmakers were inspired by the popular music of the era concept albums of groups such as pink floyd and the beatles suggested new modes of storytelling and creative techniques that could be adapted to motion pictures new filmmakers made their early films outside the hollywood establishment away from the influence of film labor unions and the then rapidly dissipating studio system the contemporary title of sound designer can be compared with the more traditional title of supervising sound editor many sound designers use both titles interchangeably theatre see also sound reinforcement system and architectural acoustics sound design as a distinct discipline is one of the youngest fields in stagecraft second only to the use of projection and other multimedia displays although the ideas and techniques of sound design have been around almost since theatre started dan dugan working with three stereo tape decks routed to ten loudspeaker zones modern audio technology has enabled theatre sound designers to produce flexible complex and inexpensive designs that can be easily integrated into live performance the influence of film and television on playwriting is seeing plays being written increasingly with shorter scenes which is difficult to achieve with scenery but easily conveyed with sound the development of film sound design is giving writers and directors higher expectations and knowledge of sound design consequently theatre sound design is widespread and accomplished sound designers commonly establish longterm collaborations with directors musicals sound design for musicals often focuses on the design and implementation of a sound reinforcement system that will fulfill the needs of the production if a sound system is already installed in the performance venue it is the sound designers job to tune the system for the best use for a particular production sound system tuning employs various methods including equalization delay volume speaker and microphone placement and in some cases the addition of new equipment in conjunction with the director and musical director if any the sound reinforcement designer determines the use and placement of microphones for actors and musicians the sound reinforcement designer ensures that the performance can be heard and understood by everyone in the audience regardless of the shape size or acoustics of the venue and that performers can hear everything needed to enable them to do their jobs while sound design for a musical largely focuses on the artistic merits of sound reinforcement many musicals such as into the woods also require significant sound scores see sound design for plays sound reinforcement design was recognized by the american theatre wings tony awards with the tony award for best sound design of a musical until the 201415 season plays sound design for plays often involves the selection of music and sounds sound score for a production based on intimate familiarity with the play and the design installation calibration and utilization of the sound system that reproduces the sound score the sound designer for a play and the productions director work together to decide the themes and emotions to be explored based on this the sound designer for plays in collaboration with the director and possibly the composer decides upon the sounds that will be used to create the desired moods in some productions the sound designer might also be hired to compose music for the play the sound designer and the director usually work together to spot the cues in the play ie decide when and where sound will be used in the play some productions might use music only during scene changes whilst others might use sound effects likewise a scene might be underscored with music sound effects or abstract sounds that exist somewhere between the two some sound designers are accomplished composers writing and producing music for productions as well as designing sound many sound designs for plays also require significant sound reinforcement see sound design for musicals sound design for plays was recognized by the american theatre wings tony awards with the tony award for best sound design of a play until the 201415 season professional organizations the association of sound designers is a trade association representing theatre sound designers in the uk united scenic artists usa local usa829

in qubec by lassociation des professionnels des arts du qubec apasq music in contemporary music business especially in the production of rock music ambient music progressive rock and similar genres the record producer and recording engineer play important roles in the creation of the overall sound or soundscape of a recording and less often of a live performance a record producer is responsible for extracting the best performance possible from the musicians and for making both musical and technical decisions about the instrumental timbres arrangements etc on some particularly more electronic music projects artists and producers in more conventional genres have sometimes sourced additional help from artists often credited as sound designers to contribute specific auditory effects ambiences etc to the production these people are usually more versed in eg electronic music composition and synthesizers than the other musicians on board in application of electroacoustic techniques eg binaural sound and sound synthesis for contemporary music or film music a sound designer often also an electronic musician sometimes refers to an artist who works alongside a composer to realize the more electronic aspects of a musical production this is because sometimes there exists a difference in interests between artists calling themselves composers and artists calling themselves electronic musicians or sound designers the latter being sometimes more experienced as well as interested in electronic music techniques such as sequencing and synthesizers but the former often wanting to use elements of electronic music in compositions but often being more experienced in writing music in a variety of genres since electronic music itself is quite broad in techniques and often separate from techniques applied in other genres this kind of collaboration can be seen as fairly natural as well as beneficial notable examples of recognized sound design in music are the contributions of michael brook to the u2 album the joshua tree george massenburg to the jennifer warnes album famous blue raincoat chris thomas to the pink floyd album the dark side of the moon and brian eno to the paul simon album surprise in 1974 suzanne ciani started her own production company cianimusica inc which became the 1 sound design music house in new york computer applications and other applications sound is widely used in a variety of humancomputer interfaces in computer games and video games sound production for computer applications adds few extra concerns and requirements to the sound some of them are nonrepetitiveness interactivitydynamicity and low memory and cpu use for example the most computational resources are usually devoted to graphics which in turn means that the sound playback is often limited to some upper memory consumption as well as cpu use limits these have to be added to the concerns of audio production since it is often not enough to merely create good sound but the sound also has to fit to the given computational limits while still sounding good which may require eg the use of audio compression or voice allocating systems however sound for computer applications also adds some new creative aspects to music and sound because computer sound especially in games often involves the sound having or desired to be interactive adding interactivity can involve using a variety of playback systems or logic using tools that allow the production of interactive sound eg maxmsp wwise and it also deviates from being just an art form to also requiring software or electrical engineering since implementing interactivity of sound also requires engineering of the systems that play the sound or eg process user input therefore in interactive applications a sound designer often collaborates with an engineer eg a sound programmer whos concerned with designing the playback systems and their efficiency awards sound designers have been recognized by awards organizations for some time and new awards have emerged more recently in response to advances in sound design technology and quality the motion picture sound editors and the academy of motion picture arts and sciences recognizes the finest or most aesthetic sound design for a film with the golden reel award for sound and music editing and the academy award for best sound editing respectively in 2007 the tony award for best sound design was created to honor the best sound design in american theatre on broadway north american theatrical award organizations that recognize sound designers include these dora mavor moore awards drama desk awards helen hayes awards obie awards joseph jefferson awards major british award organizations include the olivier awards the tony awards retired the

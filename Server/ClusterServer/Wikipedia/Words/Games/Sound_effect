followed by the same recording with the blackbird singing with 5 voices a sound effect or audio effect is an artificially created or enhanced sound or sound process used to emphasize artistic or other content of films television shows live performance animation video games music or other media these are normally created with foley in motion picture and television production a sound effect is a sound recorded and presented to make a specific storytelling or creative point without the use of dialogue or music the term often refers to a process applied to a recording without necessarily referring to the recording itself in professional motion picture and television production dialogue music and sound effects recordings are treated as separate elements dialogue and music recordings are never referred to as sound effects even though the processes applied to such as reverberation or flanging effects often are called sound effects history a live rooster in the yle recording studio in 1930s finland the term sound effect ranges back to the early days of radio in its year book 1931 the bbc published a major article about the use of sound effects it considers sounds effect deeply linked with broadcasting and states it would be a great mistake to think of them as anologous to punctuation marks and accents in print they should never be inserted into a programme already existing the author of a broadcast play or broadcast construction ought to have used sound effects as bricks with which to build treating them as of equal value with speech and music it lists six totally different primary genres of sound effect realistic confirmatory effect realistic evocative effect symbolic evocative effect conventionalised effect impressionistic effect music as an effect according to the author it is axiomatic that every sound effect to whatever category it belongs must register in the listeners mind instantaneously if it fails to do so its presence could not be justified film in the context of motion pictures and television sound effects refers to an entire hierarchy of sound elements whose production encompasses many different disciplines including hard sound effects are common sounds that appear on screen such as door alarms weapons firing and cars driving by background or bg sound effects are sounds that do not explicitly synchronize with the picture but indicate setting to the audience such as forest sounds the buzzing of fluorescent lights and car interiors the sound of people talking in the background is also considered a bg but only if the speaker is unintelligible and the language is unrecognizable this is known as walla these background noises are also called ambience or atmos atmosphere foley sound effects are sounds that synchronize on screen and require the expertise of a foley artist to record properly footsteps the movement of hand props eg a tea cup and saucer and the rustling of cloth are common foley units design sound effects are sounds that do not normally occur in nature or are impossible to record in nature these sounds are used to suggest futuristic technology in a science fiction film or are used in a musical fashion to create an emotional mood each of these sound effect categories is specialized with sound editors known as specialists in an area of sound effects eg a car cutter or guns cutter foley is another method of adding sound effects foley is more of a technique for creating sound effects than a type of sound effect but it is often used for creating the incidental real world sounds that are very specific to what is going on onscreen such as footsteps with this technique the action onscreen is essentially recreated to try to match it as closely as possible if done correctly it is very hard for audiences to tell what sounds were added and what sounds were originally recorded location sound in the early days of film and radio foley artists would add sounds in realtime or prerecorded sound effects would be played back from analogue discs in realtime while watching the picture today with effects held in digital format it is easy to create any required sequence to be played in any desired timeline in the days of silent film sound effects were added by the operator of a theater organ or photoplayer both of which also supplied the soundtrack of the film theater organ sound effects are usually electric or electropneumatic and activated by a button pressed with the hand or foot photoplayer operators activate sound effects either by flipping switches on the machine or pulling cowtail pullstrings which hang above sounds like bells and drums are made mechanically sirens and horns electronically due to its smaller size a photoplayer usually has less special effects than a theater organ or less complex ones video games the principles involved with modern video game sound effects since the introduction of sample playback are essentially the same as those of motion pictures typically a game project requires two jobs to be completed sounds must be recorded or selected from a library and a sound engine must be programmed so that those sounds can be incorporated into the games interactive environment in earlier computers and video game systems sound effects were typically produced using sound synthesis in modern systems the increases in storage capacity and playback quality has allowed sampled sound to be used the modern systems also frequently utilize positional audio often with hardware acceleration and realtime audio postprocessing which can also be tied to the 3d graphics development based on the internal state of the game multiple different calculations can be made this will allow for for example realistic sound dampening echoes and doppler effect historically the simplicity of game environments reduced the required number of sounds needed and thus only one or two people were directly responsible for the sound recording and design as the video game business has grown and computer sound reproduction quality has increased however the team of sound designers dedicated to game projects has likewise grown and the demands placed on them may now approach those of midbudget motion pictures music some pieces of music use sound effects that are made by a musical instrument or by other means an early example is the 18th century toy symphony richard wagner in the opera das rheingold 1869 lets a choir of anvils introduce the scene of the dwarfs who have to work in the mines similar to the introduction of the dwarfs in the 1937 disney movie snow white klaus doldingers soundtrack for the 1981 movie das boot includes a title score with a sonar sound to reflect the uboat setting john barry integrated into the title song of moonraker 1979 a sound representing the beep of a sputnik like satellite recording a man recording the sound of a saw in the 1930s the most realistic sound effects may originate from original sources the closest sound to machinegun fire could be an original recording of actual machine guns despite this real life and actual practice do not always coincide with theory when recordings of real life do not sound realistic on playback foley and fx are used to create more convincing sounds for example the realistic sound of bacon frying can be the crumpling of cellophane while rain may be recorded as salt falling on a piece of tinfoil less realistic sound effects are digitally synthesized or sampled and sequenced the same recording played repeatedly using a sequencer when the producer or content creator demands highfidelity sound effects the sound editor usually must augment his available library with new sound effects recorded in the field when the required sound effect is of a small subject such as scissors cutting cloth ripping or footsteps the sound effect is best recorded in a studio under controlled conditions such small sounds are often delegated to a foley artist and foley editor many sound effects cannot be recorded in a studio such as explosions gunfire and automobile or aircraft maneuvers these effects must be recorded by a sound effects editor or a professional sound effects recordist when such big sounds are required the recordist will begin contacting professionals or technicians in the same way a producer may arrange a crew if the recordist needs an explosion he may contact a demolition company to see if any buildings are scheduled to be destroyed with explosives in the near future if the recordist requires a volley of cannon fire he may contact historical reenactors or gun enthusiasts depending on the effect recordists may use several dat hard disk or nagra recorders and a large number of microphones during a cannon and musketfire recording session for the 2003 film the alamo conducted by jon johnson and charles maynes two to three dat machines were used one machine was stationed near the cannon itself so it could record the actual firing another was stationed several hundred yards away below the trajectory of the ball to record the sound of the cannonball passing by when the crew recorded musketfire a set of microphones were arrayed close to the target in this case a swine carcass to record the musketball impacts a counterexample is the common technique for recording an automobile for recording onboard car sounds which include the car interiors a threemicrophone technique is common two microphones record the engine directly one is taped to the underside of the hood near the engine block the second microphone is covered in a wind screen and tightly attached to the rear bumper within an inch or so of the tail pipe the third microphone which is often a stereo microphone is stationed inside the car to get the car interior having all of these tracks at once gives a sound designer or audio engineer a great deal of control over how he wants the car to sound in order to make the car more ominous or low he can mix in more of the tailpipe recording if he wants the car to sound like it is running full throttle he can mix in more of the engine recording and reduce the interior perspective in cartoons a pencil being dragged down a washboard may be used to simulate the sound of a sputtering engine what is considered today to be the first recorded sound effect was of big ben striking 1030 1045 and 1100 it was recorded on a brown wax cylinder by technicians at edison house in london on july 16 1890 this recording is currently in the public domain processing effects as the car example demonstrates the ability to make multiple simultaneous recordings of the same subjectthrough the use of several dat or multitrack recordershas made sound recording into a sophisticated craft the sound effect can be shaped by the sound editor or sound designer not just for realism but for emotional effect once the sound effects are recorded or captured they are usually loaded into a computer integrated with an audio nonlinear editing system this allows a sound editor or sound designer to heavily manipulate a sound to meet his or her needs the most common sound design tool is the use of layering to create a new interesting sound out of two or three old average sounds for example the sound of a bullet impact into a pig carcass may be mixed with the sound of a melon being gouged to add to the stickiness or gore of the effect if the effect is featured in a closeup the designer may also add an impact sweetener from his or her library the sweetener may simply be the sound of a hammer pounding hardwood equalized so that only the lowend can be heard the low end gives the three sounds together added weight so that the audience actually feels the weight of the bullet hit the victim if the victim is the villain and his death is climactic the sound designer may add reverb to the impact in order to enhance the dramatic beat and then as the victim falls over in slow motion the sound editor may add the sound of a broom whooshing by a microphone pitchshifted down and timeexpanded to further emphasize the death if the film is sciencefiction the designer may phaser the whoosh to give it a more scifi feel for a list of many sound effects processes available to a sound designer see the bottom of this article aesthetics when creating sound effects for films sound recordists and editors do not generally concern themselves with the verisimilitude or accuracy of the sounds they present the sound of a bullet entering a person from a close distance may sound nothing like the sound designed in the above example but since very few people are aware of how such a thing actually sounds the job of designing the effect is mainly an issue of creating a conjectural sound which feeds the audiences expectations while still suspending disbelief in the previous example the phased whoosh of the victims fall has no analogue in real life experience but it is emotionally immediate if a sound editor uses such sounds in the context of emotional climax or a characters subjective experience they can add to the drama of a situation in a way visuals simply cannot if a visual effects artist were to do something similar to the whooshing fall example it would probably look ridiculous or at least excessively melodramatic the conjectural sound principle applies even to happenstance sounds such as tires squealing doorknobs turning or people walking if the sound editor wants to communicate that a driver is in a hurry to leave he will cut the sound of tires squealing when the car accelerates from a stop even if the car is on a dirt road the effect will work if the audience is dramatically engaged if a character is afraid of someone on the other side of a door the turning of the doorknob can take a second or more and the mechanism of the knob can possess dozens of clicking parts a skillful foley artist can make someone walking calmly across the screen seem terrified simply by giving the actor a different gait techniques in music and filmtelevision production typical effects used in recording and amplified performances are echo to simulate the effect of reverberation in a large hall or cavern one or several delayed signals are added to the original signal to be perceived as echo the delay has to be of order 35 milliseconds or above short of actually playing a sound in the desired environment the effect of echo can be implemented using either analog or digital methods analog echo effects are implemented using tape delays andor spring reverbs when large numbers of delayed signals are mixed over several seconds the resulting sound has the effect of being presented in a large room and it is more commonly called reverberation or reverb for short flanger to create an unusual sound a delayed signal is added to the original signal with a continuously variable delay usually smaller than 10 ms this effect is now done electronically using dsp but originally the effect was created by playing the same recording on two synchronized tape players and then mixing the signals together as long as the machines were synchronized the mix would sound moreorless normal but if the operator placed his finger on the flange of one of the players hence flanger that machine would slow down and its signal would fall outofphase with its partner producing a phasing effect once the operator took his finger off the player would speed up until its tachometer was back in phase with the master and as this happened the phasing effect would appear to slide up the frequency spectrum this phasing upanddown the register can be performed rhythmically phaser another way of creating an unusual sound the signal is split a portion is filtered with an allpass filter to produce a phaseshift and then the unfiltered and filtered signals are mixed the phaser effect was originally a simpler implementation of the flanger effect since delays were difficult to implement with analog equipment phasers are often used to give a synthesized or electronic effect to natural sounds such as human speech the voice of c3po from star wars was created by taking the actors voice and treating it with a phaser chorus a delayed signal is added to the original signal with a constant delay the delay has to be short in order not to be perceived as echo but above 5 ms to be audible if the delay is too short it will destructively interfere with the undelayed signal and create a flanging effect often the delayed signals will be slightly pitch shifted to more realistically convey the effect of multiple voices equalization different frequency bands are attenuated or boosted to produce desired spectral characteristics moderate use of equalization often abbreviated as eq can be used to finetune the tone quality of a recording extreme use of equalization such as heavily cutting a certain frequency can create more unusual effects filtering equalization is a form of filtering in the general sense frequency ranges can be emphasized or attenuated using lowpass highpass bandpass or bandstop filters bandpass filtering of voice can simulate the effect of a telephone because telephones use bandpass filters overdrive effects such as the use of a fuzz box can be used to produce distorted sounds such as for imitating robotic voices or to simulate distorted radiotelephone traffic eg the radio chatter between starfighter pilots in the science fiction film star wars the most basic overdrive effect involves clipping the signal when its absolute value exceeds a certain threshold pitch shift similar to pitch correction this effect shifts a signal up or down in pitch for example a signal may be shifted an octave up or down this is usually applied to the entire signal and not to each note separately one application of pitch shifting is pitch correction here a musical signal is tuned to the correct pitch using digital signal processing techniques this effect is ubiquitous in karaoke machines and is often used to assist pop singers who sing out of tune it is also used intentionally for aesthetic effect in such pop songs as chers believe and madonnas die another day time stretching the opposite of pitch shift that is the process of changing the speed of an audio signal without affecting its pitch resonators emphasize harmonic frequency content on specified frequencies robotic voice effects are used to make an actors voice sound like a synthesized human voice synthesizer generate artificially almost any sound by either imitating natural sounds or creating completely new sounds modulation to change the frequency or amplitude of a carrier signal in relation to a predefined signal ring modulation also known as amplitude modulation is an effect made famous by doctor whos daleks and commonly used throughout scifi compression the reduction of the dynamic range of a sound to avoid unintentional fluctuation in the dynamics level compression is not to be confused with audio data compression where the amount of data is reduced without affecting the amplitude of the sound it represents 3d audio effects place sounds outside the stereo basis reverse echo a swelling effect created by reversing an audio signal and recording echo andor delay whilst the signal runs in reverse when played back forward the last echos are heard before the effected sound creating a rush like swell

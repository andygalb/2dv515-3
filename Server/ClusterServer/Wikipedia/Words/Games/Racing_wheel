racing wheel a race of forza motorsport 6 utilizing a racing wheel controller at the eb games expo 2015 a racing wheel is a method of control for use in racing video games racing simulators and driving simulators they are usually packaged with a large paddle styled as a steering wheel along with a set of pedals for gas brake and sometimes clutch actuation as well as various shifter controls an analog wheel and pedal set such as this allows the user to accurately manipulate steering angle and pedal control that is required to properly manage a simulated car as opposed to digital control such as a keyboard the relatively large range of motion further allows the user to more accurately apply the controls racing wheels have been developed for use with arcade games game consoles personal computers and also for professional driving simulators for race drivers force feedback racing wheels started off as simple plastic wheels hooked up to a rotary potentiometer which were sprung by springs or bungees eventually manufacturers began to use electric motors in the controllers in place of springs in order to achieve a level of force feedback first seen in microsofts sidewinder wheel at first this technology simply provided the centering force and other artificial effects such as shaking the wheel in a crash or other vibrations however as driving simulations have evolved their physics engines have become more accurate and the developers have linked their ingame physics more closely to the force feedback this allows the user to truly feel what forces go through the steering rack instead of just artificial effects and genuinely enhance the realism of the game despite this some high end manufacturers believe that force feedback has still not been perfected and therefore companies such as thomas superwheel have not adopted a force feedback system in their products frex on the other hand has gone the other way and equips their highend simwheel with powerful force feedback and no mechanical centering device direct drive this technology is different from the most popular racing wheels direct drive in a racing wheel that is directly driven by a force feedback motor this makes the racing wheels force feedback to have a faster response to what is happening in game normal force feedback racing wheels have gears that the wheel is mounted in this make is so there is delay from the force feedback to your arms this is because the motor is hooked up to a gear that is connected to the main gear that the racing wheel is mounted in this is what causes the delay comparison of racing wheels manufacturer product max rotation deg ffb clutch shifter brake sensor pedal type atomic lamborghini gallardo evo racing wheel 270 no no paddles potentiometer standing

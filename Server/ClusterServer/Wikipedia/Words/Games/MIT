photo by el allen leftright inverted original rogers building back bay boston 19th century in 1859 a proposal was submitted to the massachusetts general court to use newly filled lands in back bay boston for a conservatory of art and science but the proposal failed rogers a professor from the university of virginia wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances proposing that the true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is as i conceive the teaching not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts which can be done only in the workshop but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them and along with this a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws the rogers plan reflected the german research university model emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories early developments a 1905 map of mits boston campus massachusetts institute of technology boston mass two days after mit was chartered the first battle of the civil war broke out after a long delay through the war years mits first classes were held in the mercantile building in boston in 1865 mit was informally called boston tech the curriculum drifted to a vocational emphasis

the mit administration and the mit charter crossed the charles river on the ceremonial barge bucentaur built for the occasion curricular reforms in the 1930s president karl taylor compton and vicepresident effectively provost vannevar bush emphasized the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and reduced the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios still as late as 1949 the lewis committee lamented in its report on the state of education at mit that the institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school a partly unjustified perception the committee sought to change the report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum recommended offering a broader education and warned against letting engineering and governmentsponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities defense research mits involvement in military science surged during world war ii in 1941 vannevar bush was appointed head of the federal office of scientific research and development and directed funding to only a select group of universities including mit a special type of educational institution which can be defined as a university polarized around science engineering and the arts we might call it a university limited in its objectives but unlimited in the breadth and the thoroughness with which it pursues these objectives mit president james rhyne killian 1949 these activities affected mit profoundly a 1949 report noted the lack of any great slackening in the pace of life at the institute to match the return to peacetime remembering the academic tranquility of the prewar years though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities in late 1960s and early 1970s student and faculty activists protested against the vietnam war and mits defense research however six mit students were sentenced to prison terms at this time and some former student leaders such as michael albert and george katsiaficas are still indignant about mits role in military research and its suppression of these protests in the 1980s there was more controversy at mit over its involvement in sdi space weaponry and cbw chemical and biological warfare research recent history the mit media lab houses researchers developing novel uses of computer

was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education the successful student according to snyder was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms for example organized student groups had compiled course biblescollections of problemset and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references this sort of gamesmanship snyder argued hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest graduate program mits graduate program has high coexistence with the undergraduate program and many courses are taken by qualified students

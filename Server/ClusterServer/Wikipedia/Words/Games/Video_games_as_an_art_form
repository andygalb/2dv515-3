storytelling pixel art video game artists video games portalvte the concept of video games as a form of art is a controversial topic within the entertainment industry though video games have been afforded legal protection as creative works by the supreme court of the united states the philosophical proposition that video games are works of art remains in question even when considering the contribution of expressive elements such as graphics storytelling and music even art games games purposely designed to be a work of creative expression have been challenged as works of art by some critics history the earliest institutional consideration of the video game as an art form came in the late 1980s when art museums began retrospective displays of then outdated first and second generation games in exhibitions such as the museum of the moving images 1989 hot circuits a video arcade video games were showcased as preformed works whose quality as art came from the intent of the curator to display them as art the concept of the video game as a duchampstyle readymade or as found object resonated with early developers of the art game in her 2003 digital arts and culture paper arcade classics span art current trends in the art game genre professor tiffany holmes noted that a significant emerging trend within the digital art community was the development of playable video game pieces referencing or paying homage to earlier classic works like breakout asteroids pacman and burgertime at the 2010 art history of games conference in atlanta georgia professor celia pearce further noted that alongside duchamps art productions the fluxus movement of the 1960s and most immediately the new games movement had paved the way for more modern art games works such as lantz pac manhattan according to pearce have become something like performance art pieces in march 2006 the french minister of culture first characterized video games as cultural goods and as a form of artistic expression granting the industry a tax subsidy the lines between video games and art become blurred when exhibitions fit the labels of both game and interactive art the smithsonian american art museum held an exhibit in 2012 entitled the art of video games which was designed to demonstrate the artistic nature of video games including the impact of older works and the subsequent influence of video games on creative culture empathy games while many video games are recognized as art for their visual imagery and storytelling another class of games has gained attention for creating an emotional experience for the player generally by having the user roleplay as a character under a stressinducing situation covering topics associated with poverty sexuality and physical and mental illnesses controversy the characterization of games as works of art has been controversial while recognizing that games may contain artistic elements in their traditional forms such as graphic art music and story several notable figures have advanced the position that games are not artworks and may never be capable of being called art legal status american courts first began examining the question of whether video games were entitled to constitutional guarantees of free speech as under the first amendment in march 1982 in the case of americas best family showplace corp v city of new york dept of bldgs by april 2002 controversy over the topic was still a legal reality as judge stephen n limbaugh sr upon reviewing gameplay from the resident of evil creek theory of legitimation emerging art forms depend upon existing communities for recognition and legitimation even as they compete with those incumbents for ideological and material support auteur theory has led to some overlap between indie status and artistic cachet with critics praising stylistic choices in indie games when those same choices would be deplored in a commercial game who argue the characteristics that distinguish indie games from the mainstream are not inherently artistic munroe suggested that video games often face a double standard in that if they conform to traditional notions of the game as a toy for children then they are flippantly dismissed as trivial and nonartistic but if they push the envelope by introducing serious adult themes into games then they face negative criticism and controversy for failing to conform to the very standards of nonartistic triviality demanded by these traditional notions he further explained games as a type of art more akin to architecture in which the artist creates a space for the audience to experience on their own terms than to a noninteractive presentation as in cinema video game designer kim swift believes games can be artistic but denies that they need to be art in order to have cultural value she feels video games should aspire to be toys through which adults can exercise their imaginations roger ebert on video games as art the question rose to wide public attention in the mid2000s when film critic roger ebert participated in a series of controversial debates and published colloquies in 2005 following an online discussion concerning whether or not knowledge of the game doom was essential to a proper appreciation of the film doom which ebert had awarded one star as a commentary on the game ebert described video games as a nonartistic medium incomparable to the more established art forms mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0to my knowledge no one in or out of the field has ever been able to cite a game worthy of comparison with the great dramatists poets filmmakers novelists and composers that a game can aspire to artistic importance as a visual experience i accept but for most gamers video games represent a loss of those precious hours we have available to make ourselves more cultured civilized and empatheticroger ebert in 2006 ebert took part in a panel discussion at the conference on world affairs entitled an epic debate are video games an art form in which he stated that video games dont explore the meaning of being human as other art forms do one obvious difference between art and games is that you can win a game it has rules points objectives and an outcome santiago might cite a eberts essay was strongly criticized by the gaming community although ebert did not engage with the issue again and his view remains mired in controversy the notion that video games are ineligible to be considered fine art due to their commercial appeal and structure as choicedriven narratives has proved persuasive for many including video game luminary brian moriarty who in march 2011 gave a lecture on the topic entitled an apology for roger ebert other notable critics in a 2006 interview with us official playstation 2 magazine game designer hideo kojima agreed with eberts assessment that video games are not art kojima acknowledged that games may contain artwork but he stressed the intrinsically popular nature of video games in contrast to the niche interests served by art since the highest ideal of all video games is to achieve 100 player satisfaction whereas art is targeted to at least one person kojima argued that video game creation is more of a service than an artistic endeavor at the 2010 art history of games conference michael samyn and auriea harvey founding members of indie studio tale of tales argued in no uncertain terms that games are not art and that they are by and large a waste of time central to tale of tales distinction between games and art is the purposive nature of games as opposed to art whereas humans possess a biological need that is only satisfied by play argues samyn and as play has manifested itself in the form of games games represent nothing more than a physiological necessity art on the other hand is not created out of a physical need but rather it represents a search for higher purposes thus the fact that a game acts to fulfill the physical needs of the player is sufficient according to samyn to disqualify it as art gamers were surprised by this controversial stance due to the frequency of prior thirdparty characterizations of tale of tales productions as art games however tale of tales clarified that the games they were making simply expanded the conception of games the characterization of their games as art games noted samyn was merely a byproduct of the imaginative stagnation and lack of progressivism in the video game industry while tale of tales acknowledged that old media featuring oneway communication was not enough and that twoway communication via computers offers the way forward for art the studio argued that such communication today is being held hostage by the video game industry in 2011 samyn further refined his argument that games are not art by emphasizing the fact that games are systematic and rulebased samyn identified an industry emphasis on gameplay mechanics as directly responsible for the marginalization of artistic narrative in games and he described modern video games as little more than digital sport pointing to systemic problems samyn criticized the current model whereby the putative artist must work through a large and highly efficient development team who may not share the artists vision however samyn does not reject the idea that games as a medium can be used to create art to create art using the medium of the video game samyn suggests that the artistic message must precede the means of its expression in the guidance of gameplay mechanics the development of funness or economic considerations must cease to guide the works creation and the development process must embrace a model wherein a single artistauthors vision gains central primacy in 2012 guardian art critic jonathan jones published an article arguing that games are more like a playground and not art jones also notes that the nature of creating video games robs one persons reaction to life and that no one owns the game so there is no artist and therefore no work of art in 2013 video game journalist patricia hernandez described a puzzle in the interactive fiction game photopia the solution of the puzzle involves a reveal regarding the players controlled playable character prompting experiences which hernandez argues could not be made as powerful as they are in any other art form without interactivity hernandez says

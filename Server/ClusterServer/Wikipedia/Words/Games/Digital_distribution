distribution of digital media content such as audio video software and video games the term is generally used to describe distribution over an online delivery medium such as the internet thus bypassing physical distribution methods such as paper optical discs and vhs videocassettes the term online distribution is typically applied to freestanding products downloadable addons for other products are more commonly known as downloadable content with the advancement of network bandwidth capabilities online distribution became prominent in the 21st century content distributed online may be streamed or downloaded and often consists of books films and television programs music software and video games streaming involves downloading and using content at a users request or ondemand rather than allowing a user to store it permanently in contrast fully downloading content to a hard drive or other form of storage media may allow offline access in the future specialist networks known as content delivery networks help distribute content over the internet by ensuring both high availability and high performance alternative technologies for content delivery include peertopeer file sharing technologies alternatively content delivery platforms create and syndicate content remotely acting like hosted content management systems however the term is also used in film distribution to describe distribution of content through physical media in opposition to distribution by analog media such as photographic film and magnetic tape see digital cinema basis a primary characteristic of online distribution is its direct nature to make a commercially successful work artists usually must enter their industrys publishing chain publishers help artists advertise fund and distribute their work to retail outlets in some industries particularly video games artists find themselves bound to publishers and in many cases unable to make the content they want the publisher might not think it will profit well this can quickly lead to the standardization of the content and to the stifling of new potentially risky ideas by opting for online distribution an artist can get their work into the public sphere of interest easily with potentially minimum business overhead this often leads to cheaper goods for the consumer increased profits for the artists as well as increased artistic freedom online distribution platforms often contain or act as a form of digital rights management online distribution also opens the door to new business models eg the open music model for instance an artist could release one track from an album or one chapter from a book at a time instead of waiting for them all to be completed this either gives them a cash boost to help continue their projects or warns that their work is not financially viable this is hopefully done before they have spent excessive money and time on a project deemed unviable video games have increased flexibility in this area demonstrated by micropayment models a clear result of these new models is their accessibility to smaller artists or artist teams who do not have the time funds or expertise to make a new product in one go an example of this can be found in the music industry indie artists may access the same distribution channels as major record labels with potentially fewer restrictions and manufacturing costs there is a growing collection of internet labels that offer distribution to unsigned or independent artists directly to online music stores and in some cases marketing and promotion services further many bands are able to bypass this completely and offer their music for sale via their own independently controlled websites an issue is the large number of incompatible formats in which content is delivered restricting the devices that may be used or making data conversion necessary impact on traditional retail the rise of online distribution has provided controversy for the traditional business models and resulted in challenges as well as new opportunities for traditional retailers and publishers online distribution affects all of the traditional media markets including music press and broadcasting in britain the iplayer a software application for streaming television and radio accounts for 5 of all bandwidth used in the united kingdom music the move towards online distribution led to a dip in sales in the 2000s when cd sales were nearly cut in half the smaller file size yields much greater internet transfer speeds the transition into the online space has boosted sales and profit for some artists it has also allowed for potentially lower expenses such as lower coordination costs lower distribution costs as well as the possibility for redistributed total profits these lower costs have aided new artists in breaking onto the scene and gaining recognition in the past some emerging artists have struggled to find a way to market themselves and compete in the various distribution channels the internet may give artists more control over their music in terms of ownership rights creative process pricing and more in addition to providing global users with easier access to content online stores allow users to choose the songs they wish instead of having to purchase an entire album from which there may only be one or two titles that the buyer enjoys the number of downloaded single tracks rose from 160 million in 2004 to 795 million in 2006 which accounted for a revenue boost from us397 million to us2 billion

code usd also abbreviated us and referred to as the dollar us dollar or american dollar is the official currency of the united states and its territories per the united states constitution since 1792 for most practical purposes it is divided into 100 smaller cent units but is occasionally divided into 1000 mills for accounting purposes the circulating paper money consists of federal reserve notes that are denominated in united states dollars 12 usc418 since the suspension in 1971 overview articlei section8 of the us constitution provides that the congress has the power to coin money these other coins are more fully described in coins of the united states dollar the constitution provides that a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time the us dollar may therefore be described as the unit of account of the united states the word dollar is one of the words in the first paragraph of section 9 of article i of the constitution there dollars is a reference to the spanish milled dollar a coin that had a monetary value of 8 spanish units of currency or reales in 1792 the us congress passed a coinage act section 9 of that act authorized the production of various coins including dollars or unitseach to be of the value of a spanish milled dollar as the same is now current and to contain three hundred and seventyone grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver section 20 of the act provided that the money of account of the united states shall be expressed in dollars or units and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the united states shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation in other words this act designated the united states dollar as the unit of currency of the united states unlike the spanish milled dollar the us dollar is based upon a decimal system of values in addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or onethousandth of a dollar symbol cent or onehundredth of a dollar symbol dime or onetenth of a dollar and eagle or ten dollars with prescribed weights and composition of gold silver or copper for each it was proposed in the mid1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the 50 half union exist however only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar dime is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10 while eagle and mill are largely unknown to the general public though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies and gasoline prices are usually in the form of xxx9 per gallon eg 3599 more commonly written as 359910 when currently issued in circulating form denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as us coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as federal reserve notes with the exception of gold silver platinum and palladium coins valued up to 100 as legal tender but worth far more as bullion both onedollar coins and notes are produced today although the note form is significantly more common in the past paper money was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar fractional currency and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of 20 known as the double eagle discontinued in the 1930s the term eagle was used in the coinage act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars and subsequently was used in naming gold coins paper currency less than one dollar in denomination known as fractional currency was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as shinplasters in 1854 james guthrie then secretary of the treasury proposed creating 100 50 and 25 gold coins which were referred to as a union half union and quarter union thus implying a denomination of 1 union 100 series of 1917 1 united states bill today usd notes are made from cotton fiber paper unlike most common paper which is made of wood fiber us coins are produced by the united states mint us dollar banknotes are printed by the bureau of engraving and printing and since 1914 have been issued by the federal reserve the largesized notes issued before 1928 measured 742 by 3125 inches 1885 by 794mm smallsized notes introduced that year measure 614 by 261 by 00043 inches 15596 by 6629 by 011mm when the current smaller sized us currency was introduced it was referred to as philippinesized currency because the philippines had previously adopted the same size for its legal currency the philippine peso etymology further information dollar in the 16th century count hieronymus schlick of bohemia began minting coins known as joachimstalers named for joachimstal the valley where the silver was mined the german word for valley is thal or nowadays usually tal cognate with dale in english st joachims valley is now known as jchymov in the czech republic then part of the kingdom of bohemia alternatively thaler is said to come from the german coin guldengroschen great guilder being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder minted from the silver from joachimsthal the coins minted at joachimsthal soon lent their name to other coins of similar size and weight from other places one such example was a dutch coin depicting a lion hence its dutch name leeuwendaler in english lion dollar the leeuwendaler was authorized to contain 42716 grains of 75 fine silver and passed locally for between 36 and 42 stuivers it was lighter than the largedenomination coins then in circulation thus it was more advantageous for a dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in leeuwendalers and it became the coin of choice for foreign trade the leeuwendaler was popular in the dutch east indies and in the dutch north american new netherland colony tristate area and circulated throughout the thirteen colonies during the 17th and early 18th centuries it was also separately popular throughout eastern europe where it led to the current romanian and moldovan currency being called leu literally lion among the englishspeaking community the dutch coin came to be popularly known as lion dollar and is the origin of the english dollar by analogy with this lion dollar spanish pesos with the same weight and shape as the lion dollar came to be known as spanish dollars eventually dollar became the name of the first official american currency nicknames see also slang terms for money united states the colloquialism bucks much like the british word quids pl for the pound sterling is often used to refer to dollars of various nations including the us dollar the original note was printed in black and green on the back side it is still used to refer to the us dollar but not to the dollars of other countries other wellknown names of the dollar as a whole in denominations include greenmail green and dead presidents the last because deceased presidents are pictured on most bills a grand sometimes shortened to simply g is a common term for the amount of 1000 the suffix k or k from kilo is also commonly used to denote this amount such as 10k to mean 10000 however the 1000 note is no longer in general use a large or stack it is usually a reference to a multiple of 1000 such as fifty large meaning 50000 the 100 note is nicknamed benjamin benji ben or franklin after benjamin franklin cnote c being the roman numeral for 100 century note or bill eg two bills being 200 the 50 note is occasionally called a yardstick or a grant after president ulysses s grant pictured on the obverse the 20 note is referred to as a double sawbuck jackson after andrew jackson or double eagle the 10 note is referred to as a sawbuck tenspot or hamilton after alexander hamilton the 5 note as lincoln fin fiver or fivespot the infrequentlyused 2 note is sometimes called deuce tom or jefferson after thomas jefferson the 1 note as a single or buck the dollar has also been referred to as a bone and bones in plural eg twenty bones is equal to 20 the newer designs with portraits displayed in the main body of the obverse rather than in cameo insets upon paper colorcoded by denomination are sometimes referred to as bigface notes or monopoly money piastre was the original french word for the us dollar used for example in the french text of the louisiana purchase calling the dollar a piastre is still common among the speakers of cajun french and new england french modern french uses dollar for this unit of currency as well the term is still used as slang for us dollars in the frenchspeaking caribbean islands most notably haiti dollar sign dollar sign spanish silver real or peso of 1768 the symbol usually written before the numerical amount is used for the us dollar as well as for many other currencies the sign was the result of a late 18thcentury evolution of the scribal abbreviation ps for the peso the common name for the spanish dollars that were in wide circulation in the new world from the 16th to the 19th centuries these spanish pesos or dollars were minted in spanish america namely in mexico city potos bolivia and lima peru the p and the s eventually came to be written over each other giving rise to another popular explanation is that it is derived from the pillars of hercules on the spanish coat of arms of the spanish dollar these pillars of hercules on the silver spanish dollar coins take the form of two vertical bars and a swinging cloth band in the shape of an s yet another explanation suggests that the dollar sign was formed from the capital letters u and s written or printed one on top of the other this theory popularized by novelist ayn rand in atlas shrugged history see also history of the

reserve note the american dollar coin was initially based on the value and look of the spanish dollar or piece of eight used widely in spanish america from the 16th to the 19th centuries the first dollar coins issued by the united states mint founded 1792 were similar in size and composition to the spanish dollar minted in mexico and peru the spanish us silver dollars and later mexican silver pesos circulated side by side in the united states and the spanish dollar and mexican peso remained legal tender until the coinage act of 1857 the coinage of various english colonies also circulated the lion dollar was popular in the dutch new netherland colony new york but the lion dollar also circulated throughout the english colonies during the 17th century and early 18th century examples circulating in the colonies were usually worn so that the design was not fully distinguishable thus they were sometimes referred to as dog dollars the us dollar was first defined by the coinage act of 1792 which specified a dollar to be based in the spanish milled dollar and of 371 grains and 4 sixteenths part of a grain of pure or 416 grains 270g of standard silver and an eagle to be 247 and 4 eighths of a grain or 270 grains 17g of gold again depending on purity the choice of the value 371 grains arose from alexander hamiltons decision to base the new american unit on the average weight of a selection of worn spanish dollars hamilton got the treasury to weigh a sample of spanish dollars and the average weight came out to be 371 grains a new spanish dollar was usually about 377 grains in weight and so the new us dollar was at a slight discount in relation to the spanish dollar the same coinage act also set the value of an eagle at 10 dollars and the dollar at 110 eagle it called for 90 silver alloy coins in denominations of 1 12 14 110 and 120 dollars it called for 90 gold alloy coins in denominations of 1 12 14 and 110 eagles the value of gold or silver contained in the dollar was then converted into relative value in the economy for the buying and selling of goods this allowed the value of things to remain fairly constant over time except for the influx and outflux of gold and silver in the nations economy the early currency of the united states did not exhibit faces of presidents as is the custom now the currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th century before that heads side of coinage used profile faces and striding seated and standing figures from greek and roman mythology and composite native americans the last coins to be converted to profiles of historic americans were the dime 1946 and the dollar 1971 for articles on the currencies of the colonies and states see connecticut pound delaware pound georgia pound maryland pound massachusetts pound new hampshire pound new jersey pound new york pound north carolina pound pennsylvania pound rhode island pound south carolina pound and virginia pound continental currency continental one third dollar bill obverse see also continental currency during the american revolution the thirteen colonies became independent states freed from british monetary regulations they each issued sd paper money to pay for military expenses the continental congress also began issuing continental currency denominated in spanish dollars the dollar was valued relative to the states currencies at the following rates 5 shillings georgia 6 shillings connecticut massachusetts new hampshire rhode island virginia 712 shillings delaware maryland new jersey pennsylvania 8 shillings new york north carolina 3212 shillings south carolina continental currency depreciated badly during the war giving rise to the famous phrase not worth a continental the currency was ultimately replaced by the silver dollar at the rate of 1 silver dollar to 1000 continental dollars silver and gold standards from 1792 when the mint act was passed the dollar was defined as 37125 grains 24056 g of silver the gold coins that were minted were not given any denomination and traded for a market value relative to the congressional standard of the silver dollar 1834 saw a shift in the gold standard to 232 grains 150g followed by a slight adjustment to 2322 grains 1505g in 1837 161 ratio in 1862 paper money was issued without the backing of precious metals due to the civil war silver and gold coins continued to be issued and in 1878 the link between paper money and coins was reinstated this disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the war of 1812 the use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also occurred under the articles of confederation from 1777 to 1788 with no solid backing and being easily counterfeited the continentals quickly lost their value giving rise to the phrase not worth a continental this was a primary reason for the no state shall make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts clause in article 1 section 10 of the united states constitution in order to finance the war of 1812 congress authorized the issuance of treasury notes interestbearing shortterm debt that could be used to pay public dues while they were intended to serve as debt they did function to a limited extent as money treasury notes were again printed to help resolve the reduction in public revenues resulting from the panic of 1837 and the panic of 1857 as well as to help finance the mexicanamerican war and the civil war in addition to treasury notes in 1861 congress authorized the treasury to borrow 50 million in the form of demand notes which did not bear interest but could be redeemed on demand for precious metals however by december 1861 the union governments supply of specie was outstripped by demand for redemption and they were forced to suspend redemption temporarily the following february congress passed the legal tender act of 1862 issuing united states notes which were not redeemable on demand and bore no interest but were legal tender meaning that creditors had to accept them at face value for any payment except for public debts and import tariffs however silver and gold coins continued to be issued resulting in the depreciation of the newly printed notes through greshams law in 1869 supreme court ruled in hepburn v griswold that congress could not require creditors to accept united states notes but overturned that ruling the next year in the legal tender cases in 1875 congress passed the specie payment resumption act requiring the treasury to allow us notes to be redeemed for gold after january 1 1879 the treasury ceased to issue united states notes in 1971 the gold standard act of 1900 abandoned the bimetallic standard and defined the dollar as 2322 grains 1505g of gold equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at 2067 silver coins continued to be issued for circulation until 1964 when all silver was removed from dimes and quarters and the half dollar was reduced to 40 silver silver half dollars were last issued for circulation in 1970 gold coins were confiscated by executive order 6102 issued in 1933 by franklin roosevelt the gold standard was changed to 1371 grains 0888g equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at 35 this standard persisted until 1968 between 1968 and 1975 a variety of pegs to gold were put in place eventually culminating in a sudden end on august 15 1971 to the convertibility of dollars to gold later dubbed the nixon shock the last peg was 4222 per ounce before the us dollar was allowed to freely float on currency markets according to the bureau of engraving and printing the largest note it ever printed was the 100000 gold certificate series 1934 these notes were printed from december 18 1934 through january 9 1935 and were issued by the treasurer of the united states to federal reserve banks only against an equal amount of gold bullion held by the treasury these notes were used

silver content which was removed in 1971 and replaced with cupronickel however since 1992 the us mint has produced special silver proof sets in addition to the regular yearly proof sets with silver dimes quarters and half dollars in place of the standard coppernickel versions in addition an experimental 400 stella coin was also minted in 1879 but never placed into circulation and is properly considered to be a pattern rather than an actual coin denomination the 50 coin mentioned was only produced in 1915 for the panamapacific international exposition 1915 celebrating the opening of the panama canal only 1128 were made 645 of which were octagonal this remains the only us coin that was not round as well as the largest and heaviest us coin ever produced a 100 gold coin was produced in high relief during 2015 although it was primarily produced for collectors not for general circulation from 1934 to present the only denominations produced for circulation have been the familiar penny nickel dime quarter half dollar and dollar the nickel is the only coin still in use today that is essentially unchanged except in its design from its original version every year since 1866 the nickel has been 75 copper and 25 nickel except for 4 years during world war ii when nickel was needed for the war due to the pennys low value some efforts have been made to eliminate the penny as circulating coinage collector coins the united states mint produces proof sets specifically for collectors and speculators silver proofs tend to be the standard designs but with the dime quarter and half dollar containing 90 silver starting in 1983 and ending in 1997 the mint also produced proof sets containing the years commemorative coins alongside the regular coins another type of proof set is the presidential dollar proof set where four special 1 coins are minted each year featuring a president because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins the production of new presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on december 13 2011 by us treasury secretary timothy f geithner future minting of such coins will be made solely for

dollar coins coins of the united states dollar the first united states dollar was minted in 1794 known as the flowing hair dollar contained 416 grains of standard silver 8925 silver and 1075 copper as specified by section 13 of the coinage act of 1792 it was designated by section 9 of that act as having the value of a spanish milled dollar dollar coins have not been very popular in the united states in february 2007 the us mint under the presidential 1 coin act of 2005 early releases of the washington coin included error coins shipped primarily from the philadelphia mint to florida and tennessee banks highly sought after by collectors and trading for as much as 850 each within a week of discovery the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions e pluribus unum in god we trust 2007 p the mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly philadelphia although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to heads some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying upside down lettering error coins some cynics also erroneously point out that the federal reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years whereas coins are more permanent the fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes which have been withdrawn from circulation bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones as

denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969 these notes were used primarily in interbank transactions or by organized crime it was the latter usage that prompted president richard nixon to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use with the advent of electronic banking they became less necessary notes in denominations of 500 1000 5000 10000 and 100000 were all produced at one time see large denomination bills in us currency for details with the exception of the 100000 bill which was only issued as a series 1934 gold certificate and was never publicly circulated thus it is illegal to own these notes are now collectors items and are worth more than their face value to collectors though still predominantly green post2004 series incorporate other colors to better distinguish different denominations as a result of a 2008 decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the american council of the blind the bureau of engraving and printing is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note except the 1 and the current version of the 100 bill it also plans larger highercontrast numerals more color differences and distribution of currency readers to assist the visually impaired during the transition period means of issue the monetary base consists of coins and federal reserve notes in circulation outside the federal reserve banks and the us treasury plus deposits held by depository institutions at federal reserve banks the adjusted monetary base has increased from approximately 400 billion dollars in 1994 to 800 billion in 2005 and over 3000 billion in 2013 when the federal reserve makes a purchase it credits the sellers reserve account with the federal reserve this money is not transferred from any existing fundsit is at this point that the federal reserve has created new highpowered money commercial banks can freely withdraw in cash any excess reserves from their reserve account at the federal reserve to fulfill those requests the federal reserve places an order for printed money from the us treasury department the treasury department in turn sends these requests to the bureau of engraving and printing to print new dollar bills and the bureau of the mint to stamp the coins usually the shortterm goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific shortterm interest rate target in other instances monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold for example in the case of the united states the federal reserve targets the federal funds rate the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight the other primary means of conducting monetary policy include i discount window lending as lender of last resort ii fractional deposit lending changes in the reserve requirement iii moral suasion cajoling certain market players to achieve

war ii under the bretton woods system established after world war ii the value of gold was fixed to 35 per ounce and the value of the us dollar was thus anchored to the value of gold rising government spending in the 1960s however led to doubts about the ability of the united states to maintain this convertibility gold stocks dwindled as banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold and as a result the value of the dollar began to decline facing an emerging currency crisis and the imminent danger that the united states would no longer be able to redeem dollars for gold gold convertibility was finally terminated in 1971 by president nixon resulting in the nixon shock the value of the us dollar was therefore no longer anchored to gold and it fell upon the federal reserve to maintain the value of the us currency the federal reserve however continued to increase the money supply resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the us dollar in the 1970s this was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were linked the phillips curve and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign in 1979 president carter appointed paul volcker chairman of the federal reserve the federal reserve tightened the money supply and inflation was substantially lower in the 1980s and hence the value of the us dollar stabilized over the thirtyyear period from 1981 to 2009 the us dollar lost over half its value there is ongoing debate about whether central banks should target zero inflation which would mean a constant value for the us dollar over time or low stable inflation which would mean a continuously but slowly declining value of the dollar over time as is the case now although some economists are in favor of a zero inflation policy and therefore a constant value for the us dollar exchange rates historical exchange rates currency units per us dollar averaged over the year 19702 19802 19852 19902

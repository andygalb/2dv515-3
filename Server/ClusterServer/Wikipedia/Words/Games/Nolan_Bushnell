bushnells now live in southern california in june 2008 it was announced that leonardo dicaprio would portray bushnell in the film atari an adaptation of bushnells life story despite the announcement however no progress has been made on the project business career syzygy in 1969 bushnell and colleague ted dabney formed syzygy with the intention of producing a spacewar clone known as computer space dabney built the prototype and bushnell shopped it around looking for a manufacturer they made an agreement with nutting associates a maker of coinop trivia and shooting games who produced a fiberglass cabinet for the unit that included a coinslot mechanism computer space was a commercial failure though sales exceeded 3 million and decided that his next game would be licensed to a bigger manufacturer atari inc the magnavox odyssey provided the inspiration for bushnells successful pong atari inc in 1972 bushnell and dabney set off on their own after bushnell attended a burlingame california demonstration of the magnavox odyssey he gave the task of making the magnavox tennis game into a coinop version to alcorn as a test project he told alcorn that he was making the game for general electric in order to motivate him but in actuality he planned to simply dispose of the game alcorn incorporated many of his own improvements into the game design such as the ball speeding up the longer the game went on and pong was born pong proved to be very popular atari released a large number of pongbased arcade games over the next few years as the mainstay of the company the atari 2600 would go on to revolutionize the home gaming market but bushnell was forced out of atari not long after its release in 1974 atari entered the consumer electronics market after engineers harold lee and bob brown approached alcorn with an idea to develop a home version of pong with a marketing and distribution agreement with sears pong sales soared when the unit was released in 1975 using borrowed parts from atari having the main pcb printed up by atari employee howard cantin and receiving further assistance from atari employee ron wayne two nonemployees steve jobs and steve wozniakboth of whom had previously been involved in the development of the atari arcade game breakoutcreated and marketed their own home computer they offered the design to bushnell but atari had no desire to build computers at the time instead focusing on the arcade and home console markets in 1976 steve jobs went to nolan to get him to put in some money in exchange for a minor equity stake in apple nolan remarked steve asked me if i would put 50000 in and he would give me a third of the company i was so smart i said no its kind of fun to think about that when im not crying by 1976 atari was in the midst of developing the atari vcs video computer system later renamed the atari 2600 but bushnell realized that if the company was going to grow it needed capital and with the stock market in a bleak condition going public would not be the solution he made a list of companies to approach to buy atari meanwhile steve ross ceo of warner communications noticed that his children were hovering around video game cabinets at walt disney world warner communications was contacted about atari by one of its investors to discuss purchasing the company bringing the capital they needed for the vcs launch which took place in august 1977 in november 1978 bushnell was forced out of the company after a dispute with warner over its future direction notably on the lifespan of the atari 2600 and their closed software strategy which was later changed for the new home computer division by 1982 atari had us13 billion in annual sales and was the fastestgrowing company in the history of american business by 1984 the company had crashed and was split into three pieces to be sold off the coinop division became atari games the consumer division was sold to jack tramiel who folded it

wanted to work for walt disney but was continually turned down for employment when he was first starting out after graduation chuck e cheeses was his homage to disney and the technology developed

money sente though profitable was sold to bally for 39 million and kadabrascope was sold to lucas which became the beginnings of what became pixar during this time bushnell was using large loans on his pizza time stock to fund catalyst by the end of 1983 chuck e cheese was having serious financial problems president and longtime friend joe keenan resigned that fall nolan tried to step back in

headquartered in menlo park california became a wholly owned subsidiary of tele atlas while many of the ideas eventually led to currentday innovations most of catalysts companies eventually failed due

2018 the advisory committee of the game developers choice awards announced that bushnell would receive the pioneer award at the march ceremony at the game developers conference gdc crediting his role at atari the following day the advisory committee reconsidered the selection of bushnell for the award i applaud the gdc for ensuring that their institution reflects what is right specifically with regards to how people should be treated in the workplace and if that means an award is the price i have to pay personally so the whole industry may be more aware and sensitive to these issues i applaud that too if my personal actions or the actions of anyone who ever worked with me offended or caused pain to anyone at our companies then i apologize without reservation nolanbushnell twitter january 31 2018 in a later statement to kotaku bushnell cautioned that exploring these kinds of issues through a finite 40yearold prism elaine shirley who worked at atari during the bushnell years said those were the times he loni reeder who was responsible for communications security and facilities at atari and later cofounded uwink with bushnell stated i was treated fairly and paid well i have fellow atari women friends who also know nolan none of us were offended by him carol kantor the first games user researcher and who led an allfemale games user research team at atari the women interviewed by kotaku generally considered the attack and decision related to bushnells award as unfair and expressed anger at those that had raised the issue with the committee the situation has led to discussion of how the atari workplace may have influenced the current video game industry kotaku observed that the percentage of females in the video game industry has declined since 1991 to as low as 15 as of 2016 which is difficult to attribute but suggested may be tied to a portion of women that would not be able to withstand the type of workplace of the 1980s atari atari inc business is fun

fictional sciencebased depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science such as extraterrestrial lifeforms alien worlds extrasensory perception and time travel along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft robots cyborgs interstellar travel or other technologies science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition in many cases tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held the genre has existed since the early years of silent cinema when georges melies a trip to the moon 1902 employed trick photography effects the next major example in the genre was the film metropolis 1927 being the first feature length science fiction movie from the 1930s to the 1950s the genre consisted mainly of lowbudget b movies after stanley kubricks landmark 2001 a space odyssey 1968 the science fiction film genre was taken more seriously in the late 1970s bigbudget science fiction films filled with special effects became popular with audiences after the success of star wars and paved the way for the blockbuster hits of subsequent decades characteristics of the genre according to vivian sobchack an american cinema and media theorist and cultural critic science fiction film is a film genre which emphasizes actual extrapolative or speculative science and the empirical method interacting in a social context with the lesser emphasized but still present transcendentalism of magic and religion in an attempt to reconcile man with the unknown sobchack 63 this definition suggests a continuum between realworld empiricism and supernatural transcendentalism with science fiction film on the side of empiricism and horror film and fantasy film on the side of transcendentalism however there are numerous wellknown examples of science fiction horror films epitomized by such pictures as frankenstein and alien the visual style of science fiction film can be characterized by a clash between alien and familiar images this clash is implemented when alien images become familiar as in a clockwork orange when the repetitions of the korova milkbar make the alien decor seem more familiar finally alien and familiar images are juxtaposed as in the deadly mantis when a giant praying mantis is shown climbing the washington monument cultural theorist scott bukatman has proposed that science fiction film allows contemporary culture to witness an expression of the sublime be it through exaggerated scale apocalypse or transcendence history metropolis 1927 by fritz lang was one of the first

interest of film auteurs in science fiction science fiction films from the early 1970s explored the theme of paranoia in which humanity is depicted as under threat from sociological ecological or technological adversaries of its own creation such as george lucass directional debut thx 1138 1971 the andromeda strain 1971 silent running 1972 soylent green 1973 westworld 1973 and its sequel

invasion eg independence day 1996 and genetic experimentation eg jurassic park 1993 and gattaca 1997 also the star wars prequel trilogy began with the release of star wars episode i the phantom menace which eventually grossed over one billion dollars as the decade progressed computers played an increasingly important role in both the addition of special effects thanks to terminator 2 judgment day and jurassic park and the production of films as software developed in sophistication it was used to produce more complicated effects it also enabled filmmakers to enhance the visual quality of animation resulting in films such as ghost in the shell 1995 from japan and the iron giant 1999 from the united states during the first decade of the 2000s superhero films abounded as did earthbound science fiction such as the matrix trilogy in 2005 the star wars saga was completed with the darkly themed star wars episode iii revenge of the sith sciencefiction also returned as a tool for political commentary in films such as ai artificial intelligence minority report sunshine district 9 children of men serenity sleep dealer and pandorum the 2000s also saw the release of transformers

planets 2017 and ex machina 2015 which won the academy award for visual effects in a surprising upset over the much higherbudget star wars the force awakens 2015 themes imagery and visual elements science fiction films are often speculative in nature and often include key supporting elements of science and technology however as often as not the science in a hollywood science fiction movie can be considered pseudoscience relying primarily on atmosphere and quasiscientific artistic fancy than facts and conventional scientific theory the definition can also vary depending on the viewpoint of the observer many science fiction films include elements of mysticism occult magic or the supernatural considered by some to be more properly elements of fantasy or the occult or religious film in the film this part of the primitive mind manifests itself as monstrous destructive force emanating from the freudian subconscious or id some films blur the line between the genres such as films where the protagonist gains the extraordinary powers of the superhero these films usually employ quasiplausible reason for the hero gaining these powers not all science fiction themes are equally suitable for movies science fiction horror is most common often enough these films could just as well pass as westerns or world war ii films if the science fiction props were removed common motifs also include voyages and expeditions to other planets and dystopias while utopias are rarethings to come 1936citation neededdateapril 2009 imagery film theorist vivian sobchack argues that science fiction films differ from fantasy films in that while science fiction film seeks to achieve our belief in the images we are viewing fantasy film instead attempts to suspend our disbelief the science fiction film displays the unfamiliar and alien in the context of the familiar despite the alien nature of the scenes and science fictional elements of the setting the imagery of the film is related back to mankind and how we relate to our surroundings while the science fiction film strives to push the boundaries of the human experience they remain bound to the conditions and understanding of the audience and thereby contain prosaic aspects rather than being completely alien or abstract genre films such as westerns or war movies are bound to a particular area or time period this is not true of the science fiction film however there are several common visual elements that are evocative of the genre these include the spacecraft or space station alien worlds or creatures robots and futuristic gadgets examples include movies like lost in space serenity avatar prometheus tomorrowland passengers and valerian and the city of a thousand planets more subtle visual clues can appear with changes of the human form through modifications in appearance size or behavior or by means a known environment turned eerily alien such as an empty city scientific elements peter sellers as the titular character from dr strangelove 1964 while science is a major element of this genre many movie studios take significant liberties with scientific knowledge such liberties can be most readily observed in films that show spacecraft maneuvering in outer space the vacuum should preclude the transmission of sound or maneuvers employing wings yet the soundtrack is filled with inappropriate flying noises and changes in flight path resembling an aircraft banking the filmmakers unfamiliar with the specifics of space travel focus instead on providing acoustical atmosphere and the more familiar maneuvers of the aircraft similar instances of ignoring science in favor of art can be seen when movies present environmental effects as portrayed in star wars and star trek entire planets are destroyed in titanic explosions requiring mere seconds whereas an actual event of this nature takes many hours the role of the scientist has varied considerably in the science fiction film genre depending on the public perception of science and advanced technology in the monster films of the 1950s the scientist often played a heroic role as the only person who could provide a technological fix for some impending doom reflecting the distrust of government that began in the 1960s in the united states the brilliant but rebellious scientist became a common theme often serving a cassandralike role during an impending disaster biotechnology eg cloning is a popular scientific element in films as depicted in jurassic park cloning of extinct species the island cloning of humans and genetic modification in some superhero movies and in the alien series cybernetics and holographic projections as depicted in robocop and i robot are also popularized interstellar travel and teleportation is a popular theme in the star trek series that is achieved through warp drives and transporters while intergalactic travel is popular in films such as stargate and star wars that is achieved through hyperspace or wormholes nanotechnology is also featured in the star trek series in the form of replicators utopia in the day the earth stood still in the form of grey goo dystopia and in iron man 3 in the form of extremis nanotubes force fields is a popular theme in independence day while invisibility is also popular in star trek arc reactor technology featured in iron man is similar to a cold fusion device miniaturization technology where people are shrunk to microscopic sizes is featured in films like fantastic voyage 1966 honey i shrunk the kids 1989 and marvels antman 2015 the late arthur c clarkes third law states that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic past science fiction films have depicted fictional magical technologies that became present reality for example the personal access display device from star trek was a precursor of smartphones and tablet computers gesture recognition in the movie minority report is part of current game consoles humanlevel artificial intelligence is also fast approaching with the advent of smartphone ai while a working cloaking device material is the main goal of stealth technology autonomous cars eg kitt from the knight rider series and quantum computers like in the movie stealth and transcendence also will be available eventually furthermore although clarkes laws does not classify sufficiently advanced technologies the kardashev scale measures a civilizations level of technological advancement into types due to its exponential nature scifi civilizations usually only attain type i harnessing all the energy attainable from a single planet and strictly speaking often not even that alien lifeforms extraterrestrials in fiction the concept of life particularly intelligent life having an extraterrestrial origin is a popular staple of science fiction films early films often used alien life forms as a threat or peril to the human race where the invaders were frequently fictional representations of actual military or political threats on earth as observed in films such as mars attacks starship troopers the alien series the predator series and the chronicles of riddick series some aliens were represented as benign and even beneficial in nature in such films as escape to witch mountain et the extraterrestrial close encounters of the third kind the fifth element the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy avatar valerian and the city of a thousand planets and the men in black series in order to provide subject matter to which audiences can relate the large majority of intelligent alien races presented in films have an anthropomorphic nature possessing human emotions and motivations in films like cocoon my stepmother is an alien species contact the box knowing the day the earth stood still and the watch the aliens were nearly human in physical appearance and communicated in a common earth language however the aliens in stargate and prometheus were human in physical appearance but communicated in an alien language a few films have tried to represent intelligent aliens as something utterly different from the usual humanoid shape eg an intelligent life form surrounding an entire planet in solaris the ball shaped creature in dark star microbiallike creatures in the invasion shapeshifting creatures in evolution recent trends in films involve buildingsize alien creatures like in the movie pacific rim where the cgi has tremendously improved over the previous decades as compared in previous films such as godzilla disaster films disaster film a frequent theme among science fiction films is that of impending or actual disaster on an epic scale these often address a particular concern of the writer by serving as a vehicle of warning against a type of activity including technological research in the case of alien invasion films the creatures can provide as a standin for a feared foreign power disaster films typically fall into the following general categories alien invasion hostile extraterrestrials arrive and seek to supplant humanity they are either overwhelmingly powerful or very insidious typical examples include the war of the worlds 1953 invasion of the body snatchers 1956 independence day 1996 war of the worlds 2005 the day the earth stood still 2008 skyline 2010 the darkest hour 2011 battle los angeles 2011 battleship 2012 the avengers 2012 man of steel 2013 pacific rim 2013 enders game 2013 pixels 2015 independence day resurgence 2016 and justice league 2017 environmental disaster such as major climate change or an asteroid or comet strike movies that have employed this theme include soylent green 1973 waterworld 1995 deep impact 1998 armageddon 1998 the core 2003 the day after tomorrow 2004 2012 2009 snowpiercer 2013 and geostorm 2017 man supplanted by technology typically in the form of an allpowerful computer advanced robots or cyborgs or else genetically modified humans or animals among the films in this category are the terminator series the matrix trilogy i robot 2004 and the transformers series nuclear war usually in the form of a dystopic postholocaust tale of grim survival examples of such a storyline can be found in the movies dr strangelove 1964 planet of the apes 1968 a boy and his dog 1975 mad max 1979 city of ember 2008 the book of eli 2010 oblivion 2013 and mad max fury road 2015 pandemic a highly lethal disease often one created by man threatens or wipes out most of humanity in a massive plague this topic has been treated in such films as the andromeda strain 1971 the omega man 1971 12 monkeys 1995 28 weeks later 2007 i am legend 2007 and the resident evil series monster films monster movie while monster films do not usually depict danger on a global or epic scale science fiction film also has a long tradition of movies featuring monster attacks these differ from similar films in the horror or fantasy genres because science fiction films typically rely on a scientific or at least pseudoscientific rationale for the monsters existence rather than a supernatural or magical reason often the science fiction film monster is created awakened or evolves because of the machinations of a mad scientist a nuclear accident or a scientific experiment gone awry typical examples include the beast from 20000 fathoms 1953 jurassic park films cloverfield pacific rim the kong films and the godzilla series of films mind and identity the core mental aspects of what makes us human has been a staple of science fiction films particularly since the 1980s blade runner examined what made an organiccreation a human while the robocop series saw an android mechanism fitted with the brain and reprogrammed mind of a human to create a cyborg the idea of brain transfer was not entirely new to science fiction film as the concept of the mad scientist transferring the human mind to another body is as old as frankenstein while the idea of corporations behind mind transfer technologies is observed in later films such as gamer avatar and surrogates films such as total recall have popularized a thread of films that explore the concept of reprogramming the human mind the theme of brainwashing in several films of the sixties and seventies including a clockwork orange and the manchurian candidate coincided with secret reallife government experimentation during project mkultra voluntary erasure of memory is further explored as themes of the films paycheck and eternal sunshine of the spotless mind some films like limitless explore the concept of mind enhancement the anime series serial experiments lain also explores the idea of reprogrammable reality and memory the idea that a human could be entirely represented as a program in a computer was a core element of the film tron this would be further explored in the film version of the lawnmower man transcendence and ready player one and the idea reversed in virtuosity as computer programs sought to become real persons in the matrix series the virtual reality world became a realworld prison for humanity managed by intelligent machines in movies such as existenz the thirteenth floor and inception the nature of reality and virtual reality become intermixed with no clear distinguishing boundary telekinesis and telepathy are featured in movies like star wars the last mimzy race to witch mountain chronicle and lucy while precognition is featured in minority report robots transformers characters at universal studios hollywoodrobots have been a part of science fiction since the czech playwright karel apek coined the word in 1921 in early films robots were usually played by a human actor in a boxy metal suit as in the phantom empire although the female robot in metropolis is an exception the first depiction of a sophisticated robot in a united states film was gort in the day the earth stood still robots in films are often sentient and sometimes sentimental and they have filled a range of roles in science fiction films robots have been supporting characters such as robby the robot in forbidden planet data in star trek sidekicks eg c3po and r2d2 from star wars jarvis from iron man and extras visible in the background to create a futuristic setting eg back to the future part ii total recall 2012 robocop 2014 as well robots have been formidable movie villains or monsters eg the robot box in the film logans run 1976 hal 9000 in 2001 a space odyssey ariia in eagle eye robot sentinels in xmen days of future past the battle droids in star wars in some cases robots have even been the leading characters in science fiction films in the film blade runner 1982 many of the characters are bioengineered android replicants in the animated films walle 2008 astro boy 2009 big hero 6 2014 and in ghost in the shell 2017 films like bicentennial man ai artificial intelligence chappie and ex machina depicted the emotional fallouts of robots that are selfaware other films like the animatrix the second renaissance present the consequences of massproducing selfaware androids as humanity succumbs to their robot overlords one popular theme in science fiction film is whether robots will someday replace humans a question raised in the film adaptation of isaac asimovs i robot in jobs and in the film real steel in sports or whether intelligent robots could develop a conscience and a motivation to protect take over or destroy the human race as depicted in the terminator transformers and in avengers age of ultron another theme is remote telepresence via androids as depicted in surrogates and iron man 3 as artificial intelligence becomes smarter due to increasing computer power some scifi dreams have already been realized for example the computer deep blue beat the world chess champion in 1997 and a documentary film game over kasparov and the machine was released in 2003 another famous computer called watson defeated the two best human jeopardy game show players in 2011 and a nova documentary film smartest machine on earth was released in the same year buildingsize robots are also becoming a popular theme in movies as featured in pacific rim future live action films may include an adaptation of popular television series like voltron and robotech the cgi robots of pacific rim and the power rangers 2017 reboot was greatly improved as compared to the original mighty morphin power rangers the movie 1995 while size does matter a famous tagline of the movie godzilla incredibly small robots called nanobots do matter as well eg borg nanoprobes in star trek and nanites in i robot time travel time travel in fiction the concept of time traveltravelling backwards and forwards through timehas always been a popular staple of science fiction film and science fiction television series time travel usually involves the use of some type of advanced technology such as h g wells classic the time machine the commercially successful 1980sera back to the future trilogy bill teds excellent adventure the terminator series dj vu 2006 source code 2011 edge of tomorrow 2014 and tomorrowland 2015 other movies such as the planet of the apes series timeline 2003 and the last mimzy 2007 explained their depictions of time travel by drawing on physics concepts such as the special relativity phenomenon of time dilation which could occur if a spaceship was travelling near the speed of light and wormholes some films show time travel not being attained from advanced technology but rather from an inner source or personal power such as the 2000sera films donnie darko mr nobody the butterfly effect and xmen days of future past more conventional time travel movies use technology to bring the past to life in the present or in a present that lies in our future the film iceman 1984 told the story of the reanimation of a frozen neanderthal the film freejack 1992 shows time travel used to pull victims of horrible deaths forward in time a splitsecond before their demise and then use their bodies for spare parts a common theme in time travel film is the paradoxical nature of travelling through time in the french new wave film la jete 1962 director chris marker depicts the selffulfilling aspect of a person being able to see their future by showing a child who witnesses the death of his future self la jete was the inspiration for 12 monkeys 1995 director terry gilliams film about time travel memory and madness the back to the future series and the time machine goes one step further and explores the result of altering the past while in star trek first contact 1996 and star trek 2009 the crew must rescue the earth from having its past altered by timetravelling cyborgs and alien races genre as commentary on social issues the science fiction film genre has long served as useful means of discussing sensitive topical issues without arousing controversy and it often provides thoughtful social commentary on potential unforeseen future issues the fictional setting allows for a deeper examination and reflection of the ideas presented with the perspective of a viewer watching remote events most controversial issues in science fiction films tend to fall into two general storylines utopian or dystopian either a society will become better or worse in the future because of controversy most science fiction films will fall into the dystopian film category rather than the utopian category the types of commentary and controversy presented in science fiction films often illustrate the particular concerns of the periods in which they were produced early science fiction films expressed fears about automation replacing workers and the dehumanization of society through science and technology for example the man in the white suit 1951 used a science fiction concept as a means to satirize postwar british establishment conservatism industrial capitalists and trade unions another example is hal 9000 from 2001 a space odyssey 1968 he controls the shuttle and later harms its crew kubricks vision reveals technology as a competitive force that must be defeated in order for humans to evolve later films explored the fears of environmental catastrophe technologycreated disasters or overpopulation and how they would impact society and individuals eg soylent green elysium the monster movies of the 1950slike godzilla 1954served as standins for fears of nuclear war communism and views on the cold war stanley kubricks a clockwork orange presented a horrific vision of youth culture portraying a youth gang engaged in rape and murder along with disturbing scenes of forced psychological conditioning serving to comment on societal responses to crime logans run depicted a futuristic swingers utopia that practiced euthanasia as a form of population control and the stepford wives anticipated a reaction to the womens liberation movement enemy mine demonstrated that the foes we have come to hate are often just like us even if they appear alien contemporary science fiction films continue to explore social and political issues one recent example is minority report 2002 debuting in the months after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and focused on the issues of police powers privacy and civil liberties in a nearfuture united states some movies like the island 2005 and never let me go 2010 explore the issues surrounding cloning more recently the headlines surrounding events such as the iraq war international terrorism the avian influenza scare and united states antiimmigration laws have found their way into the consciousness of contemporary filmmakers the film v for vendetta 2006 drew inspiration from controversial issues such as the patriot act and the war on terror while science fiction thrillers such as children of men also 2006 district 9 2009 and elysium 2013 commented on diverse social issues such as xenophobia propaganda and cognitive dissonance avatar 2009 had remarkable resemblance to colonialism of native land mining by multinationalcorporations and the iraq war future noir lancaster university professor jamaluddin bin aziz argues that as science fiction has evolved and expanded it has fused with other film genres such as gothic thrillers and film noir when science fiction integrates film noir elements bin aziz calls the resulting hybrid form future noir a form which encapsulates a postmodern encounter with generic persistence creating a mixture of irony pessimism prediction extrapolation bleakness and nostalgia future noir films such as brazil blade runner 12 monkeys dark city and children of men use a protagonist who is increasingly dubious alienated and fragmented at once dark and playful like the characters in gibsons neuromancer yet still with the shadow of philip marlowe future noir films that are set in a postapocalyptic world restructure and rerepresent society in a parody of the atmospheric world usually found in noirs construction of a citydark bleak and beguiled future noir films often intermingle elements of the gothic thriller genre such as minority report which makes references to occult practices and alien with its tagline in space no one can hear you scream and a space vessel nostromo that hark film versus literature when compared to science fiction literature science fiction films often rely less on the human imagination and more upon action scenes and special effectcreated alien creatures and exotic backgrounds since the 1970s film audiences have come to expect a high standard for special effects in science fiction films in some cases science fictionthemed films superimpose an exotic futuristic setting onto what would not otherwise be a sciencefiction tale nevertheless some critically acclaimed science fiction movies have followed in the path of science fiction literature using story development to explore abstract concepts influence of science fiction authors jules verne was the first major science fiction author to be adapted for the screen with melies le voyage dans la lune 1902 and 20000 lieues sous les mers 1907 which used vernes scenarios as a framework for fantastic visuals by the time vernes work fell out of copyright in 1950 the adaptations were treated as period pieces his works have been adapted a number of times since then including 20000 leagues under the sea 1954 from the earth to the moon 1958 and two film versions of journey to the center of the earth in 1959 and 2008 2001 a space odyssey the landmark 1968 collaboration between filmmaker stanley kubrick and classic science fiction author arthur c clarke featured groundbreaking special effects such as the realization of the space ship discovery one pictured here h g wells novels the invisible man things to come and the island of doctor moreau were all adapted into films during his lifetime while the war of the worlds was updated in 1953 and again in 2005 adapted to film at least four times altogether the time machine has had two film versions 1961 and 2002 while sleeper in part is a pastiche of wells 1910 novel the sleeper awakes with the dropoff in interest in science fiction films during the 1940s few of the golden age science fiction authors made it to the screen a novella by john w campbell provided the basis for the thing from another world 1951 robert a heinlein contributed to the screenplay for destination moon 1950 but none of his major works were adapted for the screen until the 1990s the puppet masters 1994 and starship troopers 1997 isaac asimovs fiction influenced the star wars and star trek films but it was not until 1988 that a film version of one of his short stories nightfall was produced the first major motion picture adaptation of a fulllength asimov work was bicentennial man 1999 based on the short stories bicentennial man and the positronic man the latter cowritten with robert silverberg although i robot 2004 a film loosely based on asimovs book of short stories by the same name drew more attention the adaptation of science fiction author arthur c clarkes novel as 2001 a space odyssey won the academy award for visual effects and offered thematic complexity not typically associated with the science fiction genre at the time its sequel 2010 was commercially successful but less highly regarded by critics reflecting the times two earlier science fiction works by ray bradbury were adapted for cinema in the 1960s with fahrenheit 451 and the illustrated man kurt vonneguts slaughterhousefive was filmed in 1971 and breakfast of champions in 1998 philip k dicks fiction has been used in a number of science fiction films in part because it evokes the paranoia that has been a central feature of the genre films based on dicks works include blade runner 1982 total recall 1990 impostor 2001 minority report 2002 paycheck 2003 a scanner darkly 2006 and the adjustment bureau 2011 these films are loose adaptations of the original story with the

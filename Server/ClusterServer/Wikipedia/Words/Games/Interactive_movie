portalvte an interactive movie also known as a movie game is a video game that presents its gameplay in a cinematic scripted manner often through the use of fullmotion video of either animated or liveaction footage in modern times in a pejorative way design this genre came about with the invention of laserdiscs and laserdisc players the first nonlinear or random access video play devices the fact that a laserdisc player could jump to and play any chapter instantaneously rather than proceed in a linear path from start to finish like videotape meant that games with branching plotlines could be constructed from outoforder video chapters in much the same way as choose your own adventure books could be constructed from outoforder pages or the way an interactive film is constructed by choosing from a web of linked narratives thus interactive movies were animated or filmed with real actors like movies or in some later cases rendered with 3d models and followed a main storyline alternative scenes were filmed to be triggered after wrong or alternate allowable actions of the player such as game over scenes a popular example of a commercial interactive movie was the 1983 arcade game dragons lair featuring a full motion video fmv cartoon by exdisney animator don bluth where the player controlled some of the moves of the main character when in danger the player was to decide which move or action or combination to choose if they chose the wrong move they would see a lose a life scene until they found the correct one which would allow them to see the rest of the story there was only one possible successful storyline in dragons lair the only activity the user had was to choose or guess the move the designers intended them to make despite the lack of interactivity dragons lair was very popular the hardware for these games consisted of a laserdisc player linked to a processor configured with interface software that assigned a jumptochapter function to each of the controller buttons at each decision point much as a choose your own adventure book might say if you turn left go to page 7 if you turn right go to page 8 the controller for dragons lair or cliff hanger would be programmed to go to the next chapter in the successful story if a player pressed the right button or to go to the death chapter if he pressed the wrong one because laserdisc players of the day were not robust enough to handle the constant wear placed on them by constant arcade use they required frequent replacement the laserdiscs that contained the footage were ordinary laserdiscs with nothing special about them save for the order of their chapters and if removed from the arcade console would readily display their video on standard noninteractive laserdisc players later advances in technology allowed interactive movies to overlay multiple fields of fmv called vites in much the same way as polygonal models and sprites are overlaid on top of backgrounds in traditional video game graphics history the first example of interactive cinema was kinoautomat 1967 which was written and directed by radz inera this movie was first screened at expo 67 in montreal this film was produced before the invention of the laserdisc or similar technology so a live moderator appeared on stage at certain points to ask the audience to choose between two scenes the chosen scene would play following an audience vote the first interactive movie game was nintendos wild gunman a 1974 electromechanical arcade game that used film reel projection to display liveaction fullmotion video fmv footage of wild west gunslingers an early attempt to combine random access video with computer games was rollercoaster written in basic for the apple ii by david lubar for david h ahl editor of creative computing this was a text adventure that could trigger a laserdisc player to play portions of the feature film rollercoaster 1977 the program was conceived and written in 1981 and published in the january 1982 issue of creative computing along with an article by lubar detailing its creation an article by ahl claiming that rollercoaster is the first videocomputer game hybrid and proposing a theory of videocomputer interactivity and other articles reviewing hardware necessary to run the game and do further experiments the first arcade laserdisc video game was segas astron belt an early thirdperson space combat rail shooter featuring liveaction fullmotion video footage largely borrowed from a japanese science fiction film over which the playerenemy ships and laser fire are superimposed around the same time the laserdisc games begas battle and cliff hanger were also released several laserdisc games added their own innovations to the genre begas battle released by data east in 1983 introduced branching paths in which there were multiple correct moves at certain points in the animation and the move the player chose would affect the order of later scenes space ace another don bluth animated game released by cinematronics the following year also featured a similar branching formula eshs aurunmilla and ninja hayate overlaid crude computer graphics on top of the animation to indicate the correct input to the player which the 1985 games time gal and road blaster also featured because dragons lair and space ace were immensely popular they spawned a deluge of sequels and similar laserdisc games despite the astronomical cost of the animation to cut costs several companies simply hacked together scenes from anime that were obscure to american audiences of the day one such early example was sterns cliff hanger a 1983 game released around the same time which used footage from the lupin iii movies castle of cagliostro directed by hayao miyazaki and mystery of mamo another example released around that time was begas battle which used footage from harmagedon though it used a different approach introducing a new form of video game storytelling using brief fullmotion video cutscenes to develop a story between the games shooting stages years later this would become the standard approach to video game storytelling in 1987 the game night trap featuring fullmotion video was created for hasbros controlvision video game system originally codenamed nemo which used vhs tapes when hasbro discontinued production of controlvision the footage was placed into archive until it was purchased in 1991 by the founders of digital pictures digital pictures ported night trap to the sega cd platform releasing it in 1992 in 1988 epyx announced three vcr games including one based on its video game california games they combined videotape footage with a board game in the late 1980s american laser games started to produce a wide variety of liveaction light gun laserdisc video games which played much like the early cartoon games but used a light gun instead of a joystick to affect the action meanwhile digital pictures started to produce a variety of interactive movies for home consoles when cdroms were embedded in home computers games with live action and full motion video featuring actors were considered cuttingedge and some interactive movies were made some notable adventure games from this era are under a killing moon the pandora directive gabriel knight 2 the beast within voyeur star trek klingon star trek borg ripper snatcher black dahlia the xfiles game phantasmagoria bad day on the midway and the dark eye others in the action genre are brain dead 13 and star wars rebel assault due to the limitation of memory and disk space as well as the lengthy timeframes and high costs required for the production not many variations and alternative scenes for possible player moves were filmed so the games tended not to allow much freedom and variety of gameplay thus interactive movie games were not usually very replayable after being completed once from the time of its original introduction the dvd format specification has included the ability to use an ordinary dvd player to play interactive games such as dragons lair which was reissued on dvd the scene it and other series of dvd games or games that are included as bonus material on movie dvds aftermath media founded by rob landeros of trilobyte released the interactive movies tender loving care and point of view pov for the dvd platform such games have appeared on dvds aimed at younger target audiences such as the special features discs of the harry potter film series later video games used this approach using fully animated computer generated scenes including various adventure games such as the sound novel series by chunsoft shenmue series by sega shadow of memories by konami time travelers by level 5 and fahrenheit by quantic dream during many scenes the player has limited control of the character and chooses certain actions to progress the story other scenes are quick time event action sequences requiring the player to hit appropriate buttons at the right time to succeed some of these games such as the sound novel series shadow of memories time travelers heavy rain beyond two souls and detroit become human have numerous branching storylines that result from what actions the player takes or fails to complete properly which can include the death of major characters or failure to solve the mystery this idea was even further realized in telltales the walking dead series where player actions can drastically change future games for example different characters may be alive in the end depending on choices made by the player in the walking dead season 1 but those same characters affect the walking dead season two cast members work during the 1990s on interactive movies chroma key sets was different from traditional filmmaking they performed multiple possible actions players choose in a game usually looked into the camera to react to the player and usually did not react to others on the set such products were popular during the early 1990s as cdroms and laserdiscs made their way into the living rooms providing an alternative to the lowcapacity cartridges of most consoles as the first cdbased consoles capable of displaying smooth and textured 3d graphics appeared the fullfmv game had vanished from the mainstream circles around 1995 although it remained an option for pc adventure games for a couple more years one of the last titles released was the 1998 pc and playstation adventure the xfiles the game packed in 7 cds that same year tex murphy overseer became the first game developed specifically for dvdrom and one of the last interactive movies to make heavy use of liveaction fmv in 2014 the tex murphy series continued with a new fmv game tesla effect a tex murphy adventure specialized hardware formats laserdisc games a laserdisc video game is a video game that uses prerecorded video either liveaction or animation played from a laserdisc either as the entirety of the graphics or as part of the graphics the first arcade laserdisc game was segas astron belt an early thirdperson space combat rail shooter featuring liveaction fullmotion video footage largely borrowed from a japanese science fiction film over which the playerenemy ships and laser fire are superimposed the first laserdisc game to gain popularity in the united states was dragons lair in 1983 it contained animated scenes much like a cartoon the scenes would be played back and at certain points during playback the player would have to press a specific direction on the joystick or the button to advance the game to the next scene like a quick time event for instance a scene begins with the hero falling through a hole in a drawbridge and being attacked by tentacles if the player presses the button at this point the hero fends off the tentacles with his sword and pulls himself back up out of the hole if the player fails to press the sword button at the right time or instead presses a direction on the joystick the hero is attacked by the tentacles and crushed each move of the joystick however would produce a few moments of black screen when the graphics switched between either a successful outcome or the death of the character which interrupted the continuous flow of gameplay found in other videogame graphic systems of the time this was a common criticism of some players and critics despite the high cost of the animation a deluge of similar laserdisc video games followed dragons lair because of its immense popularity to cut costs several companies simply hacked together scenes from several japanese anime movies that were obscure in america at the time creating games like cliff hanger from hayao miyazakis castle of cagliostro and from mystery of mamo and begas battle from harmagedon both of which were released roughly around the same time as dragons lair later arcade laserdisc games include freedom fighter badlands space ace and road blaster other laserdisc video games followed the lead of astron belt by integrating more and more computer graphics with the prerecorded video for example funais inter stellar in 1983 was a forwardscrolling thirdperson rail shooter that used computer graphics for the ships and fullmotion video for the backgrounds similarly mach 3 and cube quest were vertical scrolling shooters that used the laserdisc video for the background and computer graphics for the ships the firefox arcade game included a philips laserdisc player to combine live action video and sound from the firefox film with computer generated graphics and sound the game used a special cav laserdisc containing multiple storylines stored in very short interleaved segments on the disc the player would seek the short distance to the next segment of a storyline during the vertical retrace interval by adjusting the tracking mirror allowing perfectly continuous video even as the player switched storylines under control of the games computer this method of seeking was noted for being extremely strenuous on the player and frequently led to the machines breaking slightly hindering the appeal of laserdisc arcade games in the 1990s american laser games produced a wide variety of liveaction light gun laserdisc video games which played much like the early laserdisc games but used a light gun instead of a joystick to affect the action begas battle released by data east in 1983 took a different approach and introduced a new form of video game storytelling using brief fullmotion video cut scenes to develop a story between the games shooting stages years later this would become the standard approach to video game storytelling dvd games a dvd game sometimes called dvdi dvd interactive is a standalone game that can be played on a settop dvd player the game takes advantage of technology built into the dvd format to create an interactive gaming environment compatible with most dvd players without requiring additional hardware dvd tv games were first developed in the late 1990s they were poorly received and understood as an entertainment medium however dvdbased game consoles like the playstation 2 popularized dvdbased gaming and also functioned as a dvd video player in addition the format has been used to import some video games to the dvd format allowing them to be played with a standard dvd player rather than requiring a pc examples include dragons lair and who shot johnny rock the pcconsole game tomb raider the angel of darkness was released in 2006 as a dvd game entitled lara croft tomb raider the action adventure japanese games such as visual novels and eroge that were originally made for pc are commonly ported to dvdpg a term that stands for dvd players game instead of standard save methods dvdpgs use password save systems similar game types include bdpg bluray disc players game and umdpg universal media disc players game live interactive movies the worlds first live interactive movie was my one demand reception although interactive movies had a filmic quality that spritebased games could not duplicate at the time they were a niche market the limited amount of direct interactivity put off many gamers cost was also an issue as live action video with decent production values is expensive to film while video shot on a low budget damages the overall image of the game ground zero texas cost sega around us3 million about the same as a lowbudget movie would cost in 1994 though not as crucial an issue as the limited interactivity another issue that drew criticism was the quality of the video itself he writes that since the player must process what is known and explore the options choosing a path at a branchpoint is every bit as demanding as making a decision in a conventional game but with much less reward since the result can only be one of a small number of branches defenders of the genre have argued that by allowing the player to interact with real people rather than animated characters interactive fullmotion video can produce emotional and visceral reactions that are not possible with either movies or traditional video games other uses some studios hybridized ordinary computer game play with interactive movie play the earliest examples of this were the entries in the origin systems wing commander series starting with wing commander iii heart of the tiger between combat missions wing commander iii featured cutscenes with live actors the game offered limited storyline branching based on whether missions were won or lost and on choices made at decision points during the cutscenes other games like bioforge would perhaps erroneously use the term for a game that has rich action and plot of cinematic proportionsbut in terms of gameplay has no relation to fmv movies the term is an ambiguous one since many video games follow a storyline similar to the way movies would web documentary list of interactive movies interactive cinema interactive video interactive art art

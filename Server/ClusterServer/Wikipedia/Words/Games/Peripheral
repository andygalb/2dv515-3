peripheral this article is about a computer device for other uses see peripheral disambiguation user interface peripherals a peripheral device is an ancillary device used to put information into and get information out of the computer three categories of peripheral devices exist based on their relationship with the computer an input device sends data or instructions to the computer such as a mouse keyboard graphics tablet image scanner barcode reader game controller light pen light gun microphone digital camera webcam dance pad and readonly memory an output device provides output from the computer such as a computer monitor projector printer headphones and computer speaker and an inputoutput device performs both input and output functions such as a computer data storage device including a disk drive usb flash drive memory card and tape drive many modern electronic devices such as digital watches smartphones and tablet computers have interfaces that allow them to be used as computer peripheral devices look up peripheral in wiktionary the free dictionary computer hardware controller computing display device expansion card punched card inputoutput punched tape video game accessory vtemajor fields of computer sciencenote this template roughly follows the 2012 acm computing classification systemhardware printed circuit board peripheral integrated circuit very large scale integration systems on chip socs energy consumption green computing electronic design automation hardware acceleration computer systemsorganization computer architecture embedded system realtime computing dependability networks network architecture network protocol network components network scheduler network performance evaluation network service software organization interpreter middleware virtual machine operating system software quality software notationsand tools programming paradigm programming language compiler domainspecific language modeling language software framework integrated development environment software configuration management software library software repository software development software development process requirements analysis software design software construction software deployment software maintenance programming team opensource model theory of computation model of computation formal language automata theory computational complexity theory logic semantics algorithms algorithm design analysis of algorithms algorithmic efficiency randomized algorithm computational geometry mathematicsof computing discrete mathematics probability statistics mathematical software information theory mathematical analysis numerical analysis informationsystems database management system information storage systems enterprise information system social information systems geographic information system decision support system process control system multimedia information system data mining digital library computing platform digital marketing world wide web information retrieval security cryptography formal methods security services intrusion detection system hardware security network security information security application security humancomputerinteraction interaction design social computing ubiquitous computing visualization accessibility concurrency concurrent computing parallel computing distributed computing multithreading multiprocessing artificialintelligence natural language processing knowledge representation and reasoning computer vision automated planning and scheduling search methodology control method philosophy of artificial intelligence distributed artificial intelligence machine learning supervised learning unsupervised learning reinforcement learning multitask learning crossvalidation graphics animation rendering image manipulation graphics processing unit mixed reality virtual reality image compression solid modeling appliedcomputing ecommerce enterprise software computational mathematics computational physics computational chemistry computational biology computational social science computational engineering computational healthcare digital art electronic publishing cyberwarfare electronic voting video games word processing operations research educational technology document management book category portal wikiproject commons this electronicsrelated article is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding itvte

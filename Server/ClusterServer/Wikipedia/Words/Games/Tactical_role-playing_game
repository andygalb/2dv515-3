video games principally refers to games which incorporate elements from strategy video games as an alternative to traditional roleplaying game rpg systems like standard rpgs the player typically controls a finite party and battles a similar number of enemies and like other rpgs death is usually temporary but this genre incorporates strategic gameplay such as tactical movement on an isometric grid and unlike other video game genres tactical rpgs tend not to feature multiplayer play a distinct difference between tactical rpgs and traditional rpgs is the lack of exploration history this

video games used a tactical form of combat such as tunnels of doom 1982 8bit origins in the east 19821990 tilebased overhead gameplay of langrisser ii buildings scenery and opposing units can form bottlenecks or choke points that players are forced to consider one of the earliest japanese rpgs koeis the dragon and princess released necs pc8001 home computer platform in 1982 during the 8bit era bokosuka wars a computer game developed by koji sumii for the sharp x1 in 1983 another notable early example of the genre was kure software koubous 1988 pc8801 strategy rpg silver ghost master of monsters developed by systemsoft and released in 1989 for the msx2 added fantasy characters and magic attacks to the gameplay of the wartime combat daisenryaku series which had instead opted for tanks planes and other vehicles of realworld modern combat master of monsters also added experience bars for the character units a concept which would be adapted and popularized by later consolebased series like fire emblem unlike many other early titles in the genre master of monsters made its way to the west via a port to the sega genesis in 1991 albeit only in north america however the genre did not become prolific until nintendo published the game that set the template for tactical wargame rpgs fire emblem ankoku ry to hikari no tsurugi developed by intelligent systems and released exclusively in japan for the nintendo famicom in 1990 fire emblem would become an archetype for the whole genre establishing gameplay elements that are still used in tactical rpgs today though many of these elements were influenced by earlier rpgs and strategy games combining the basic concepts from games like dragon quest and simple turnbased strategy elements that the development team gained experience with in their 1988 release famicom wars intelligent systems created a hit which spawned many sequels and imitators it introduced unique features such as how the characters were not interchangeable pawns but each of them were unique in terms of both class and stats and how a character who runs out of hit points would usually remain dead forever the latter mechanic was used to introduce a nonlinear storyline to the genre where different multiple endings are possible depending on which characters are alive or dead eastern console history 1991present 16bit consoles during the 16bit generation among the first imitators was langrisser by ncsmasaya first released for the mega drive genesis in 1991 it was translated for north american release and retitled warsong the langrisser series differed from fire emblem in that it used a generalsoldier structure instead of controlling main characters langrisser too spawned many sequels none of which were brought to north america langrisser set itself apart from other tactical rpgs in its time with largerscale battles where the player could control over thirty units at one time and fight against scores of enemies master of monsters was a unique title by systemsoft where langrisser and fire emblem used a squarebased grid master of monsters used a hexagonal grid players could choose one of four different lords to defend their towers and areas on the grid by building an army of creatures to destroy the opposing armies this game had a sequel for the playstation called master of monsters disciples of gaia which had limited success and was criticized for its slow gameplay both warsong and master of monsters were cited as the inspirations behind the 2005 turnbased strategy computer rpg the battle for wesnoth the first game in the longrunning super robot wars series is another early example of the genre initially released for the game boy in 1991 another influential early tactical rpg was segas shining force for the sega genesis which was released in 1992 shining force used even more console rpg elements than earlier games allowing the player to walk around towns and talk to people and buy weapons it spawned sequels shining force ii for sega genesis and shining force cd for sega cd besides the shining force gaiden 1 2 and 3 for sega game gear and shining force iii for sega saturn the games creator camelot software plannings hiroyuki takahashi cited kure software koubous 1988 tactical rpg silver ghost as his inspiration one game released solely in japan for the super nintendo entertainment system snes bahamut lagoon began squares now square enix famous line of tactical rpgs four games from the ogre battle series have been released in north america the first was ogre battle march of the black queen was released for the snes in 1993 and was more of a realtime strategy rpg in which the player forms character parties that are moved around a map in realtime when two parties meet the combat plays out with minimal user interaction the game is notable for introducing a moral alignment system that not only affects the gameplay but where tactical and strategic decisions influence the outcome of a nonlinear branching storyline which is affected by factors such as the moral alignments of the troops used to liberate a city whether to keep certain liberated cities guarded making popular or unpopular decisions concentrating power among just a few units making deals with thieves and a general sense of justice these factors lead to one of 13 possible endings alongside other factors such as how many and which units are used how battles are fought the armys reputation player characters alignment and charisma and secrets discovered the sequel tactics ogre let us cling together was originally a 1995 snes game that was not released outside japan it was later ported to the playstation along with ogre battle march of the black queen both of the playstation rereleases were marketed in north america by atlus as was ogre battle 64 person of lordly caliber for the nintendo 64 tactics ogres gameplay is more similar to the genre of tactical rpgs that final fantasy tactics belongs to which was developed by former members of quest and createdwrittendirected by yasumi matsuno complete with battles taking place on isometric grids although this game defined the genre in many ways it was not widely recognized by american gamers because it was released to american audiences several years later final fantasy tactics shared some staff members with tactics ogre and shares many of its gameplay elements a prequel to the original tactics ogre tactics ogre the knight of lodis was later released for the game boy advance a remake of let us cling together was later released for the psp in 2011 in 1996 the tactical roleplaying game fire emblem seisen no keifu also featured a nonlinear branching storyline but instead of using an alignment system it used a relationship system resembling dating sims that gave players the ability to affect the relationship points between different unitscharacters this in turn affected both the gameplay and storyline with the different possible relationships in the first generation of the games plot leading to different unitscharacters appearing during the second generation ultimately leading to different possible outcomes to the storyline 32bit consoles isometric graphics of front mission the characters movement range is indicated in blue some terrain objects such as trees block movement the terrain also shows a noticeable variation in height at different places the 32bit era saw many influential tactical rpgs such as konamis 1996 vandal hearts series which feature branching storylines that can be altered by the players dialogue choices that lead to different endings as well as segas 1997 shining force 3 sceis arc the lad collection 19961999 and squares 1997 final fantasy tactics and 1999 front mission

rotation interchangeable and hybridization of jobs or classes for each character the combination of moves between characters and the capture of npcs and having them play on your side segas sakura wars released for the sega saturn in 1996 combined tactical rpg combat with dating sim and visual novel elements introducing a realtime branching choice system where during an event or conversation the player must choose an action or dialogue choice within a time limit or not to respond at all within that time the players choice or lack thereof affects the player characters relationship with other characters and in turn the characters performance in battle the direction of the storyline and the ending later games in the series added several variations including an action gauge that can be raised up or down depending on the situation and a gauge that the player can manipulate using the analog stick depending on the situation final fantasy tactics was arguably the most responsible for bringing tactical rpgs to north america developed by former employees of quest the developer responsible for the ogre battle series it combined many elements of the final fantasy series with tactics ogrestyle gameplay it also expanded on the isometric grid combat of tactics ogre by allowing players to freely rotate the camera around the battlefield rather than keeping the camera in a fixed position the storyline of final fantasy tactics was also more linear than its predecessor in order to provide a deeper epic narrative sixth generation on sixthgeneration consoles a loyal american

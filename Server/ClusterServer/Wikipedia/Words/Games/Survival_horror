games list of gun games list of maze video games list of platform games vte survival horror is a subgenre of video games inspired by horror fiction that focuses on survival of the character as the game tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or scary ambience although combat can be part of the gameplay the player is made to feel less in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition health speed and vision or through various obstructions of the players interaction with the game mechanics the player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game games make use of strong horror themes like dark mazelike environments and unexpected attacks from enemies the term survival horror was first used for the original japanese release of resident evil in 1996 which was influenced by earlier games with a horror theme such as 1989s sweet home and 1992s alone in the dark the name has been used since then for games with similar gameplay and has been retroactively applied to earlier titles starting with the release of resident evil 4 in 2005 the genre began to incorporate more features from action games and more traditional first person and thirdperson shooter games this has led game journalists to question whether longstanding survival horror franchises and more recent franchises have abandoned the genre and moved into a distinct genre often referred to as action horror definition resident evil 1996 named and defined the survival horror genre survival horror refers to a subgenre of actionadventure video games while many action games feature lone protagonists versus swarms of enemies in a suspenseful environment game design deemphasized combat survival horror games are a subgenre of horror games the survival horror genre is also known for other noncombat challenges such as solving puzzles at certain locations in the game world enemy design a survival horror storyline usually involves the investigation and confrontation of horrific forces games typically feature a variety of monsters with unique behavior patterns history origins 1980s1996 the origins of the survival horror game can be traced back to earlier horror fiction archetypes have been linked to the books of h p lovecraft which include investigative narratives or journeys through the depths comparisons have been made between lovecrafts great old ones and the boss encounters seen in many survival horror games themes of survival have also been traced to the slasher film subgenre where the protagonist endures a confrontation with the ultimate antagonist nostromo was a survival horror game developed by akira takiguchi a tokyo university student and taito contractor for the pet 2001 it was ported to the pc6001 by masakuni mitsuhashi also known as hiromi ohba later joined game arts and published by ascii in 1981 exclusively for japan inspired by the 1980 stealth game manibiki shoujo and the 1979 scifi horror film alien the gameplay of nostromo involved a player attempting to escape a spaceship while avoiding the sight of an invisible alien which only becomes visible when appearing in front of the player the gameplay also involved limited resources where the player needs to collect certain items in order to escape the ship and if certain required items are not available in the warehouse the player is unable to escape and eventually has no choice but be killed getting caught by the alien another early example is the 1982 atari 2600 game haunted house gameplay is typical of future survival horror titles as it emphasizes puzzlesolving and evasive action rather than violence malcolm evans 3d monster maze released for the sinclair zx81 in 1982 1982 saw the release of another early horror game bandais terror house the latter half of the 1980s saw the release of several other horrorthemed games including konamis castlevania in 1986 and segas kenseiden and namcos splatterhouse in 1988 though despite the macabre imagery of these games their gameplay did not diverge much from other action games at the time shiryou sensen war of the dead a 1987 title developed by fun factory and published by victor music industries for the msx2 pc88 and pc engine platforms sweet home 1989 pictured above was a roleplaying video game often called the first survival horror and cited as the main inspiration for resident evil however the game often considered the first true survival horror due to having the most influence on resident evil was the 1989 release sweet home for the nintendo entertainment system in 1989 electronic arts published project firestart developed by dynamix unlike most other early games in the genre it featured a science fiction setting inspired by the film alien but had gameplay that closely resembled later survival horror games in many ways travis fahs considers it the first to achieve the kind of fully formed vision of survival horror as we know it today citing its balance of action and adventure limited ammunition weak weaponry vulnerable main character feeling of isolation storytelling through journals graphic violence and use of dynamically triggered music all of which are characteristic elements of later games in the survival horror genre despite this it is not likely a direct influence on later games in the genre and the similarities are largely an example of parallel thinking alone in the dark 1992 is considered a forefather of the survival horror genre and is sometimes called a survival horror game in retrospect in 1992 infogrames released alone in the dark which has been considered a forefather of the genre in 1994 riverhillsoft released doctor hauzer for the 3do both the player character and the environment are rendered in polygons the player can switch between three different perspectives thirdperson firstperson and overhead in a departure from most survival horror games doctor hauzer lacks any enemies the main threat is instead the sentient house that the game takes place in with the player having to survive the houses traps and solve puzzles the sound of the player characters echoing footsteps change depending on the surface in 1995 warps horror adventure game d featured a firstperson perspective cgi fullmotion video gameplay that consisted entirely of puzzlesolving and taboo content such as cannibalism the

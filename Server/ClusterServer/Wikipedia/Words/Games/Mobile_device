mobile device a mobile device or handheld computer is a computing device small enough to hold and operate in the hand typically any handheld computer device will have an lcd flatscreen interface providing a touchscreen interface with digital buttons and keyboard or physical buttons along with a physical keyboard many such devices can connect to the internet and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or headsets via wifi bluetooth cellular networks or near field communication nfc integrated cameras digital media players the ability to place and receive telephone calls video games and global positioning system gps capabilities are common power is typically provided by a lithium battery mobile devices may run mobile operating systems that allow thirdparty apps specialized for said capabilities to be installed and run early smartphones were joined in the late 2000s by larger but otherwise essentially the same tablets input and output is now usually via a touchscreen interface phonestablets and personal digital assistants may provide much of the functionality of a laptopdesktop computer but more conveniently in addition to exclusive features enterprise digital assistants can provide additional business functionality such as integrated data capture via barcode rfid and smart card readers by 2010 mobile devices often contained sensors such as accelerometers magnetometers and gyroscopes allowing detection of orientation and motion mobile devices may provide biometric user authentication such as face recognition or fingerprint recognition major global manufacturers of mobile devices include apple samsung sony google htc lg and motorola mobility characteristics device mobility can be viewed in the context of several dimensions physical dimensions and weight whether or not the device is mobile or some kind of host to which it is attached to is mobile what kind of host devices can be bound to how devices are attached to a host when the mobility occurs strictly speaking many socalled mobile devices are not mobile it is the host that is mobile ie a mobile human host carries a nonmobile smartphone device an example of a true mobile computing device where the device itself is mobile is a robot another example is an autonomous vehicle there are three basic ways mobile devices can be physically bound to mobile hosts accompanied surfacemounted or embedded into the fabric of a host eg an embedded controller embedded in a host device accompanied refers to an object being loosely bound and accompanying a mobile host eg a smartphone can be carried in a bag or pocket but can easily be misplaced hence mobile hosts with embedded devices such as an autonomous vehicle can appear larger than pocketsized as stated earlier the most common size of mobile computing device is pocketsized that can be handheld but other sizes for mobile devices exist too mark weiser known dust refers to miniaturised devices without direct hci interfaces eg micro electromechanical systems mems ranging from nanometres through micrometers to millimetres see also smart dust skin fabrics based upon light emitting and conductive polymers and organic computer devices these can be formed into more flexible nonplanar display surfaces and products such as clothes and curtains see oled display also see smart device although mobility is often regarded although a common form of mobile device a smartphone has a display another perhaps even more common form of smart computing device the smart card eg used as a bank card or travel card does not have a display this mobile device often has a cpu and memory but needs to connect or be inserted into a reader in order to display its internal data or state types smartphones handheld mobile devices there are many kinds of mobile devices designed for different applications this includes mobile computers mobile internet devices tabletssmartphones laptops wearable computers calculator

ruggedized for use in mobile field management uses include digitizing notes sending and receiving invoices asset management recording signatures managing parts and scanning barcodes in 2009 developments in mobile collaboration systems enabled the use of handheld devices that combine video audio and onscreen drawing capabilities to enable multiparty conferencing in realtime independent of location in the 2010s mobile devices can sync and share many data despite the distance or specifications of said devices in the medical field mobile devices are quickly becoming essential tools for accessing clinical information such as drugs treatment even medical calculation converged device html5 in mobile devices list of emerging technologies mobile interaction near field communication nfc

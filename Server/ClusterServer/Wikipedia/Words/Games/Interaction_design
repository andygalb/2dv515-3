interaction design interaction design often abbreviated as ixd is the practice of designing interactive digital products environments systems and servicesxviii while disciplines such as software engineering have a heavy focus on designing for technical stakeholders interaction design is geared toward satisfying the majority of usersxviii history the term interaction design was coined by bill moggridge the earliest programs in design for interactive technologies were the visible language workshop started by muriel cooper at mit in 1975 and the interactive telecommunications program founded at nyu in 1979 by martin elton and later headed by red burns the first academic program officially named interaction design was established at carnegie mellon university in 1994 as a master of design in interaction design at the outset the program focused mainly on screen interfaces before shifting to a greater emphasis on the big picture aspects of interactionpeople organizations culture service and system in 1990 gillian crampton smith founded the computerrelated design ma at the royal college of art rca in london changed in 2005 to design interactions in 2001 crampton smith helped found the interaction design institute ivrea a small institute in olivettis hometown in northern italy dedicated solely to interaction design the institute moved to milan in october 2005 and merged with domus academy in 2007 some of the people originally involved with idii set up the copenhagen institute of interaction design ciid after ivrea crampton smith and philip tabor added the interaction design ixd track in the visual and multimedia communication at iuav university of venice italy between 2006 and 2014 in 1998 the swedish foundation for strategic research founded the interactive institutea swedish research institute in the field of interaction design methodologies goaloriented design goaloriented design or goaldirected design is concerned with satisfying the needs and desires of the users of a product or servicexviii alan cooper argues in the inmates are running the asylum that we need a new approach to solving interactive softwarebased problems22 alternatively interfaces can be designed to serve the needs of the serviceproduct provider user needs may be poorly served by this approach usability usability answers the question can someone use this interface jacob nielsen describes usability as the quality attribute which are wellknown heuristics for creating usable systems personas personas are archetypes that describe the various goals and observed behaviour patterns among users a persona encapsulates critical behavioural data in a way that both designers and stakeholders can understand remember and relate to personas use storytelling to engage users social and emotional aspects which helps designers to either visualize the best product behaviour or see why the recommended design is successful cognitive dimensions the cognitive dimensions framework provides a vocabulary to evaluate and modify design solutions cognitive dimensions offer a lightweight approach to analysis of a design quality rather than an indepth detailed description they provide a common vocabulary for discussing notation user interface or programming language design dimensions provide highlevel descriptions of the interface and how the user interacts with it examples include consistency errorproneness hard mental operations viscosity and premature commitment these concepts aid the creation of new designs from existing ones through design maneuvers that alter the design within a particular dimension affective interaction design designers must be aware of elements that influence user emotional responses for instance products must convey positive emotions while avoiding negative ones emotion and pleasure theories exist to explain interface responses these include don normans emotional design model patrick jordans pleasure model see also interaction cost five dimensions the concept of dimensions of interaction design were introduced in moggridges book designing interactions crampton smith wrote that interaction design draws on four existing design languages 1d 2d 3d 4d words this dimension defines interactions words are the element that users interact with visual representations visual representations are the elements of an interface that the user perceives these may include but are not limited to typography diagrams icons and other graphics physical objects or space this dimension defines the objects or space with which or within which users interact time the time during which the user interacts with the interface an example of this includes content that changes over time such as sound video or animation behavior behaviour defines and how user respond to the interface interaction design association the interaction design association related disciplines industrial design the core principles of industrial design overlap with those of interaction design industrial designers use their knowledge of physical form color aesthetics human perception and desire and usability to create a fit of an object with the person using it human factors and ergonomics certain basic principles of ergonomics provide grounding for interaction design these include anthropometry biomechanics kinesiology physiology and psychology as they relate to human behavior in the built environment cognitive psychology certain basic principles of cognitive psychology provide grounding for interaction design these include mental models mapping interface metaphors and affordances many of these are laid out in donald normans influential book the design of everyday things humancomputer interaction academic research in humancomputer interaction hci includes methods for describing and testing the usability of interacting with an interface such as cognitive dimensions and the cognitive walkthrough design research interaction designers are typically informed through iterative cycles of user research user research is used to identify the needs motivations and behaviors of end users they design with an emphasis on user goals and experience and evaluate designs in terms of usability and affective influence architecture as interaction designers increasingly deal with ubiquitous computing urban informatics and urban computing the architects ability to make place and create context becomes a point of contact between the disciplines user interface design like user interface design and experience design interaction design is often associated with the design of system interfaces in a variety of media but concentrates on the aspects of the interface that define and present its behavior over time with a focus on developing the system to respond to the users experience and not the other way around design portal chief experience officer cxo data presentation architecture hardware interface design human interface

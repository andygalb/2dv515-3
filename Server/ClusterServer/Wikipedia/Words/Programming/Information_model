information model an idef1x diagram an example of an integration definition for information modeling an information model in software engineering is a representation of concepts and the relationships constraints rules and operations to specify data semantics for a chosen domain of discourse typically it specifies relations between kinds of things but may also include relations with individual things it can provide sharable stable and organized structure of information requirements or knowledge for the domain context overview the term information model in general is used for models of individual things such as facilities buildings process plants etc in those cases the concept is specialised to facility information model building information model plant information model etc such an information model is an integration of a model of the facility with the data and documents about the facility within the field of software engineering and data modeling an information model is usually an abstract formal representation of entity types that may include their properties relationships and the operations that can be performed on them the entity types in the model may be kinds of realworld objects such as devices in a network or occurrences or they may themselves be abstract such as for the entities used in a billing system typically they are used to model a constrained domain that can be described by a closed set of entity types properties relationships and operations an information model provides formalism to the description of a problem domain without constraining how that description is mapped to an actual implementation in software there may be many mappings of the information model such mappings are called data models irrespective of whether they are object models eg using uml entity relationship models or xml schemas information modeling languages a sample er diagram database requirements for a cd collection in expressg notation in 1976 an entityrelationship er graphic notation was introduced by peter chen he stressed that it was a semantic modelling technique and independent of any database modelling techniques such as hierarchical codasyl relational etc research by contemporaries of peter chen such as jrabrial 1974 and gm nijssen 1976 led to todays fact oriented modeling languages which are based on linguistic propositions rather than on entities fom tools can be used to generate an er model which means that the modeler can avoid the timeconsuming and error prone practice of manual normalization objectrole modeling language orm and fully communication oriented information modeling fcoim are both research results based upon earlier research in the 1980s there were several approaches to extend chens entity relationship model also important in this decade is remora by colette rolland the icam definition idef language was developed from the us air force icam program during the 1976 to 1982 timeframe express was created as iso 1030311 for formally specifying information requirements of product data model it is part of a suite of standards informally known as the standard for the exchange of product model data step it was first introduced in the early 1990s uml is a modeling language for specifying visualizing constructing and documenting the artifacts rather than processes of software systems it was conceived originally by grady booch james rumbaugh and ivar jacobson uml was approved by the object management group omg as a standard in 1997 the language according to lee 1999 is nonproprietary and is available to the public it is a graphical representation the language is based on the objectedoriented paradigm uml contains notations and rules and is designed to represent data requirements in terms of oo diagrams uml organizes a model in a number of views that present different aspects of a system the contents of a view are described in diagrams that are graphs with model elements a diagram contains model elements that represent common oo concepts such as classes objects messages and relationships among these concepts idef1x express and uml all can be used to create a conceptual model and according to lee 1999 each has its own characteristics although some may lead to a natural usage eg implementation one is not necessarily better than another in practice it may require more than one language to develop all information models when an application is complex in fact the modeling practice is often more important than the language chosen information models can also be expressed in formalized natural languages such as gellish gellish which has natural language variants gellish formal english gellish formal dutch gellish formeel nederlands etc is an information representation language or modeling language that is defined in the gellish smart dictionarytaxonomy which has the form of a taxonomyontology a gellish database is not only suitable to store information models but also knowledge models requirements models and dictionaries taxonomies and ontologies information models in gellish english use gellish formal english expressions for example a geographic information model might consist of a number of gellish formal english expressions such as the eiffel tower is located in paris paris is classified as a city whereas information requirements and knowledge can be expressed for example as follows tower shall be located in a geographical area city is a kind of geographical area such gellish expressions use names of concepts such as city and relation types such as is located in and is classified as a that should be selected from the gellish formal english dictionarytaxonomy or of your own domain dictionary the gellish english dictionarytaxonomy enables the creation of semantically rich information models because the dictionary contains definitions of more than 40000 concepts including more than 600 standard relation types thus an information model in gellish consists of a collection of gellish expressions that use those phrases and dictionary concepts to express facts or make statements queries and answers standard sets of information models the distributed management task force dmtf provides a standard set of information models for various enterprise domains under the general title of the common information model cim specific information models are derived from cim for particular management domains the telemanagement forum tmf has defined an advanced model for the telecommunication domain the shared informationdata model or sid as another this includes views from the business service and resource domains within the telecommunication industry the tmf has established a set of principles that an oss integration should adopt along with a set of models that provide standardized approaches the models interact with the information model the shared informationdata model or sid via a process model the business process framework etom or etom and a life cycle model building information modeling system information modelling this article incorporatespublic domain material from the national institute of

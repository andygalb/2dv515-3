metamodeling meta model redirects here for other uses see meta model disambiguation example of a geologic map information metamodel with four types of metaobjects and their selfreferences a metamodel or surrogate model is a model of a model and metamodeling is the process of generating such metamodels thus metamodeling or metamodeling is the analysis construction and development of the frames rules constraints models and theories applicable and useful for modeling a predefined class of problems as its name implies this concept applies the notions of meta and modeling in software engineering and systems engineering metamodels are of many types and have diverse applications overview a metamodel or surrogate model is a model of the model ie a simplified model of an actual model of a circuit system or software like entity metamodel can be a mathematical relation or algorithm representing input and output relations a model is an abstraction of phenomena in the real world a metamodel is yet another abstraction highlighting properties of the model itself a model conforms to its metamodel in the way that a computer program conforms to the grammar of the programming language in which it is written various types of metamodels include polynomial equations neural network kriging etc metamodeling is the construction of a collection of concepts things terms etc within a certain domain metamodeling typically involves studying the output and input relationships and then fitting right metamodels to represent that behavior common uses for metamodels are as a schema for semantic data that needs to be exchanged or stored as a language that supports a particular method or process as a language to express additional semantics of existing information as a mechanism to create tools that work with a broad class of models at run time as a schema for modeling and automatically exploring sentences of a language with applications to automated test synthesis as an approximation of a higherfidelity model for use when reducing computational cost is necessary because of the meta character of metamodeling both the praxis and theory of metamodels are of relevance to metascience metaphilosophy metatheories and systemics and metaconsciousness the concept can be useful in mathematics and has practical applications in computer science and computer engineeringsoftware engineering the latter are the main focus of this article topics metaobject facility illustration a us fea business reference model example of an ontology a dodaf metamodel definition in software engineering the use of models is an alternative to more common codebased development techniques a model always conforms to a unique metamodel one of the currently most active branch of model driven engineering is the approach named modeldriven architecture proposed by omg this approach is based on the utilization of a language to write metamodels called the meta object facility or mof typical metamodels proposed by omg are uml sysml spem or cwm iso has also published the standard metamodel isoiec 24744 all the languages presented below could be defined as mof metamodels metadata modeling metadata modeling is a type of metamodeling used in software engineering and systems engineering for the analysis and construction of models applicable and useful to some predefined class of problems see also data modeling model transformations one important move in model driven engineering is the systematic use of model transformation languages the omg has proposed a standard for this called qvt for queriesviewstransformations qvt is based on the metaobject facility or mof among many other model transformation languages mtls some examples of implementations of this standard are andromda viatra tefkat mt manydesigns portofino relationship to ontologies metamodels are closely related to ontologies both are often used to describe and analyze the relations between concepts ontologies express something meaningful within a specified universe or domain of discourse by utilizing a grammar for using vocabulary the grammar specifies what it means to be a wellformed statement assertion query etc formal constraints on how terms in the ontologys controlled vocabulary can be used together metamodeling can be considered as an explicit description constructs and rules of how a domainspecific model is built in particular this comprises a formalized specification of the domainspecific notations typically metamodels are and always should follow a strict rule set types of metamodels for software engineering several types of models and their corresponding modeling activities can be distinguished metadata modeling metadata model metaprocess modeling metaprocess model

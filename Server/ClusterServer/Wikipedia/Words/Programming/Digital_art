virtual environment at the university of illinois chicago digital art is an artistic work or practice that uses digital technology as an essential part of the creative or presentation process since the 1970s various names have been used to describe the process including computer art and multimedia art digital art is itself placed under the larger umbrella term new media art after some initial resistance lillian schwartzs comparison of leonardos self portrait and the mona lisa based on schwartzs mona leo an example of a collage of digitally manipulated photographs the techniques of digital art are used extensively by the mainstream media in advertisements and by filmmakers to produce visual effects desktop publishing has had a huge impact on the publishing world although that is more related to graphic design both digital and traditional artists use many sources of electronic information and programs to create their work digital art can be purely computergenerated such as fractals and algorithmic art or taken from other sources such as a scanned photograph or an image drawn using vector graphics software using a mouse or graphics tablet andy warhol created digital art using a commodore amiga where the computer was publicly introduced at the lincoln center new york in july 1985 an image of debbie harry was captured in monochrome from a video camera and digitized into a graphics program called propaint warhol manipulated the image adding colour by using flood fills computergenerated visual media see also computer art a procedurally generated photorealistic landscape created with terragen terragen has been used in creating cgi for movies digital visual art consists of either 2d visual information displayed on an electronic visual display or information mathematically translated into 3d information viewed through perspective projection on an electronic visual display the simplest is 2d computer graphics which reflect how you might draw using a pencil and a piece of paper in this case however the image is on the computer screen and the instrument you draw with might be a tablet stylus or a mouse what is generated on your screen might appear to be drawn with a pencil pen or paintbrush the second kind is 3dcomputer graphics where the screen becomes a window into a virtual environment where you arrange objects to be photographed by the computer typically a 2d computer graphics use raster graphics as their primary means of source data representations whereas 3d computer graphics use vector graphics in the creation of immersive virtual reality installations a possible third paradigm is to generate art in 2d or 3d entirely through the execution of algorithms coded into computer programs and could be considered the native art form of the computer that is it cannot be produced without the computer fractal art datamoshing algorithmic art and realtime generative art are examples computer generated 3d still imagery 3d computer graphics 3d graphics are created via the process of designing imagery from geometric shapes polygons or nurbs curves to create threedimensional objects and scenes for use in various media such as film television print rapid prototyping gamessimulations and special visual effects there are many software programs for doing this the technology can enable collaboration lending itself to sharing and augmenting by a creative effort similar to the open source movement and the creative commons in which users can collaborate in a project to create unique pieces of art pop surrealist artist ray caesar works in maya a 3d modeling software used for digital animation using it to create his figures as well as the virtual realms in which they exist computer generated animated imagery computergenerated imagery see also computer animation morphogenetic creations computergenerated digital art exhibition by andy lomas including animation at the watermans arts centre west london in 2016 computergenerated animations are animations created with a computer from digital models created by the 3d artists or procedurally generated the term is usually applied to works created entirely with a computer movies make heavy use of computergenerated graphics they are called computergenerated imagery cgi in the film industry in the 1990s and early 2000s cgi advanced enough so that for the first time it was possible to create realistic 3d computer animation although films had been using extensive computer images since the mid70s a number of modern films have been noted for their heavy use of photo realistic cgi digital installation art see also interactive art digital installation art constitutes a broad field of activity and incorporates many forms some resemble video installations particularly large scale works involving projections and live video capture by using projection techniques that enhance an audiences impression of sensory envelopment many digital installations attempt to create immersive environments others go even further and attempt to facilitate a complete immersion in virtual realms this type of installation is generally sitespecific scalable and without fixed dimensionality meaning it can be reconfigured to accommodate different presentation spaces noah wardripfruins screen 2003 is an example of digital installation art which makes use of a cave automatic virtual environment to create an interactive experience leading art theorists and historians leading art theorists and historians in this field include oliver grau jon ippolito christiane paul frank popper

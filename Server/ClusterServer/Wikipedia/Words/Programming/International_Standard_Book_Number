international standard book number isbn is a unique an isbn is assigned to each edition and variation except reprintings of a book for example an ebook a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different isbn the isbn is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 january 2007 and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007 the method of assigning an isbn is nationbased and varies from country to country often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country the initial isbn configuration of recognition was generated in 1967 based upon the 9digit standard book numbering sbn created in 1966 the 10digit isbn format was developed by the international organization for standardization iso and was published in 1970 as international standard iso 2108 the sbn code can be converted to a tendigit isbn by prefixing it with a zero digit 0 privately published books sometimes appear without an isbn the international isbn agency sometimes assigns such books isbns on its own initiative another identifier the international standard serial number issn identifies periodical publications such as magazines and the international standard music number ismn

the 10digit isbn format was developed by the international organization for standardization iso and was published in 1970 as international standard iso 2108 an sbn may be converted to an isbn by prefixing the digit 0 for example the second edition of mr j g reeder returns published by hodder in 1965 has sbn 340 01381 8 340 indicating the publisher 01381 their serial number and 8 being the

regardless of the publication language the ranges of isbns assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number type and size of publishers that are active some isbn registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from government to support their services in other cases the isbn registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded a full

looking up publisher codes partial lists have been compiled from library catalogs for the englishlanguage groups identifier 0 and identifier 1 publishers receive blocks of isbns with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them a small publisher may receive isbns of one or more digits for the registration group identifier several digits for the registrant and a single digit for the publication element once that block of isbns is used the publisher may receive another block of isbns with a different registrant element consequently a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements there also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country this might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers by using variable block lengths registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of isbns that they make to publishers for example a large publisher may be given a block of isbns where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element likewise countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits

binary check bit it consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number the method for the tendigit code is an extension of that for sbns the two systems are compatible and sbn prefixed with 0 will give the same checkdigit as without the digit is base eleven and can be 09 or x the system for thirteendigit codes is not compatible and will in general give a different check digit from the corresponding 10digit isbn and does not provide the same protection against transposition this is because the thirteendigit code was required to be compatible with the ean format and hence could not contain an x isbn10 check digits the 2001 edition of the official manual of the international isbn agency says that the isbn10 check digit which is the last digit of the tendigit isbn must range from 0 to 10 the symbol x is used for 10 and must be such that the sum of all the ten digits each multiplied by its integer weight descending from 10 to 1 is a multiple of 11 for example for an isbn10 of 0306406152 s 0 10 3 9 0 8 6 7 4 6 0 5 6 4 1 3 5 2 2 1 0 27 0 42 24 0 24 3 10 2 132 12 11 displaystyle beginaligneds0times 103times 90times 86times 74times 60times 56times 41times

10x19x28x37x46x55x64x73x82x9x10equiv 0pmod 11 it is also true for isbn10s that the sum of all the ten digits each multiplied by its weight in ascending order from 1 to 10 is a multiple of 11 for this

most common errors in handling an isbn eg typing or writing it are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits it can be proved that all possible valid isbn10s have at least two digits different from each other it can also be proved that there are no pairs of valid isbn10s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits these are true only because the isbn is less than 11 digits long and because 11 is a prime number the isbn check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error ie if either of these types of error has occurred the result will never be a valid isbn the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11 however if the error occurs in the publishing house and goes undetected the book will be issued with an invalid isbn in contrast it is possible for other types of error such as two altered nontransposed digits or three altered digits to result in a valid isbn although it is still unlikely isbn10 check digit calculation each of the first nine digits of the tendigit isbnexcluding the check digit itselfis multiplied by its integer weight descending from 10 to 2 and the sum of these nine products found the value of the check digit is simply the one number between 0 and 10 which when added to this sum means the total is a multiple of 11 for example the check digit for an isbn10 of 030640615 is calculated as follows s 0 10 3 9 0 8 6 7 4 6 0 5 6 4 1 3 5 2 130 displaystyle beginaligneds0times 103times 90times 86times 74times 60times 56times 41times 35times 2130endaligned adding 2 to 130 gives a multiple of 11 132 12 x 11 this is the only number between 0 and 10 which does so therefore the check digit has to be 2 and the complete sequence is isbn 0306406152 the value x 10 displaystyle x10 required to satisfy this condition might be 10 if so an x should be used alternatively modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11 the remainder of this sum when it is divided by 11 ie its value modulo 11 is computed this remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11 therefore the check digit is 11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11 modulo 11 taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0 without the second modulo operation the calculation could end up with 11 0 11 which is invalid strictly speaking the first modulo 11 is unneeded but it may be considered to simplify the calculation for example the check digit for the isbn10 of 030640615 is calculated as follows s 11 0 10 3 9 0 8 6 7 4 6 0 5 6 4 1 3 5 2 mod 11 mod 11 11 0 27 0 42 24 0 24 3 10 mod 11 mod 11 11 130 mod 11 mod 11 11 9 mod 11 2 mod 11 2 displaystyle

once at the end as shown above in which case s could hold a value as large as 496 for the invalid isbn 999999999x or s and t could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition isbn13 check digit calculation the 2005 edition of the international isbn agencys official manual describes how the 13digit isbn check digit is calculated the isbn13 check digit which is the last digit of the isbn must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits each multiplied by its integer weight alternating between 1 and 3 is a multiple of 10 formally using modular arithmetic we can say x 1 3 x 2 x 3 3 x 4 x 5 3 x 6 x 7 3 x 8 x 9 3 x 10 x 11 3 x 12 x 13 0 mod 10 displaystyle x13x2x33x4x53x6x73x8x93x10x113x12x13equiv 0pmod 10 the calculation of an isbn13 check digit begins with the first 12 digits of the thirteendigit isbn thus excluding the check digit itself each digit from left to right is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3 then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9 subtracted from 10 that leaves a result from 1 to 10 a zero 0 replaces a ten 10 so in all cases a single check digit results for example the isbn13 check digit of 978030640615 is calculated as follows s 91 73 81 03 31 03 61 43 01 63 11 53 9 21 8 0 3 0 6 12 0 18 1 15 93 93 10 9 remainder 3 10 3 7 thus the check digit is 7 and the complete sequence is isbn 9780306406157 in general the isbn13 check digit is calculated as follows let r 10 x 1 3 x 2 x 3 3 x 4 x 11 3 x 12 mod 10 displaystyle rbig 10big x13x2x33x4cdots x113x12big bmod 10big then x 13 r r 10 0 r 10 displaystyle x13begincasesrtext r100text r10endcases this check system similar to the upc check digit formula does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition specifically if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5 the check digit will not catch their transposition for instance the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1 the correct order contributes 3611 19 to the sum while if the digits are transposed 1 followed by a 6 the contribution of those two digits will be 3116 9 however 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10 and so produce the same final result both isbns will have a check digit of 7 the isbn10 formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot but requires more than the digits 09 to express the check digit additionally if the sum of the 2nd 4th 6th 8th 10th and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits 1st 3rd 5th 7th 9th 11th and 13th the total will always be divisible by 10 ie end in 0 isbn10 to isbn13 conversion the conversion is quite simple as one only needs to prefix 978 to the existing number and calculate the new checksum using the isbn13 algorithm errors in usage publishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the isbn check digit publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its isbn before publishing it that failure causes book identification problems for libraries booksellers and readers for example isbn0590764845 is shared by two books ninja gaiden a novel based on the bestselling game by tecmo 1990 and wacky laws 1997 both published by scholastic most libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid isbn issued by the publisher the library of congress catalogue contains books published with invalid isbns which it usually tags with the phrase cancelled isbn oclc often indexes by invalid isbns if the book is indexed in that way by a member library eisbn only the term isbn should be used the terms eisbn and eisbn have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided if a book exists in one or more digital ebook formats each of those formats must have its own isbn in other words each of the three separate epub amazon kindle and pdf formats of a particular book will have its own specific isbn they should not share the isbn of the paper version and there is no generic eisbn which encompasses all the ebook formats for a title ean format used in barcodes and upgrading currently the barcodes on a books back cover or inside a massmarket paperback books front cover are ean13 they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits called an ean5 for the currency and the recommended retail price for 10digit isbns the number 978 the bookland country code is prefixed to the isbn in the barcode data and the check digit is recalculated according to the ean13 formula modulo 10 1x and 3x weighting on alternating digits partly because of an expected shortage in certain isbn categories the international organization for standardization iso decided to migrate to a thirteendigit isbn isbn13 the process began 1 january 2005 and was planned to conclude 1 january 2007 all the 13digit isbns began with 978 as the 978 isbn supply is exhausted the 979 prefix was introduced part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the musicland code for musical scores with an ismn the 10digit ismn codes differed visually as they began with an m letter the bar code represents the m as a zero 0 and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3 all ismns are now 13 digits commencing 9790 9791 to 9799 will be used by isbn publisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 isbns likewise there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same moreover the tendigit isbn check digit generally is not the same as the thirteendigit isbn check digit because the gtin13 is part of the global trade item number gtin system that includes the gtin14 the gtin12 and the gtin8 the 13digit isbn falls within the 14digit data field range barcode format compatibility is maintained because aside from the group breaks the isbn13 barcode format is identical to the ean barcode format of existing 10digit isbns so migration to an eanbased system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and nonbook products that is compatible with existing isbn based data with only minimal changes to information technology systems hence many booksellers eg barnes noble migrated to ean barcodes as early as march 2005 although many american and canadian booksellers were able to read ean13 barcodes before 2005 most general retailers could not read them the upgrading of the upc barcode system to full ean13 in 2005 eased

alan kay for other people named alan kay see alan kay disambiguation alan curtis kay born may 17 1940 he is best known for his pioneering work on objectoriented programming and windowing graphical user interface design he is the president of the viewpoints research institute and an adjunct professor of computer science at the university of california los angeles he is also on the advisory board of ttivanguard until mid2005 he was a senior fellow at hp labs a visiting professor at kyoto university and an adjunct professor at the massachusetts institute of technology mit kay is also a former professional jazz guitarist composer and theatrical designer and an amateur classical pipe organist early life and work in an interview on education in america with the davis group ltd kay said

learn how to read fluently starting at the age of three so i had read maybe 150 books by the time i hit 1st grade and i already knew that the teachers were lying to me originally from springfield massachusetts kays family relocated several times due to his fathers career in physiology before ultimately settling in the new york metropolitan area when he was nine he attended the prestigious brooklyn technical high school where he was suspended due to insubordination in his senior year having already accumulated enough credits to graduate kay then attended bethany college in bethany west virginia he majored in biology and minored in mathematics before he was asked to leave by the administration for protesting the institutions jewish quota thereafter kay taught guitar in denver colorado for a year and hastily enlisted in the united states air force when the local draft board inquired about his nonstudent status assigned as a computer programmer a rare billet dominated by women due to the secretarial connotations of the field in the era after passing an aptitude test he devised an early crossplatform file transfer system following his discharge kay enrolled at the university of colorado boulder earning a bachelors degree in mathematics and molecular biology in 1966 before and during this time he worked as a professional jazz guitarist during his studies at cu he wrote the music for an adaptation of the hobbit and other campus theatricals in the autumn of 1966 he began graduate school at the university of utah college of engineering he earned an ms in electrical engineering in 1968 before taking his phd in computer science in 1969 his doctoral dissertation flex a flexible extendable language described the invention of a computer language known as flex while at utah he worked with father of computer graphics ivan sutherland best known for writing such pioneering programs as sketchpad this greatly inspired kays evolving views on objects and programming as he grew busier with arpa research he ended his musical career in 1968 he met seymour papert and learned of the logo programming language a dialect of lisp optimized for educational purposes this led him to learn of the work of jean piaget jerome bruner lev vygotsky and of constructionist learning further influencing his professional orientation leaving utah as an associate professor of computer science in 1969 kay became a visiting researcher at the stanford artificial intelligence laboratory in anticipation of accepting a professorship at carnegie mellon university instead in 1970 he joined the xerox parc research staff in palo alto california throughout the decade he developed prototypes of networked workstations using the programming language smalltalk these inventions were later commercialized by apple in their lisa and macintosh computers kay is one of the fathers of the idea of objectoriented programming which he named along with some colleagues at parc some of the original objectoriented concepts including the use of the words object and class had been developed for simula 67 at the norwegian computing center later he said im sorry that i long ago coined the term objects for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea the big idea is messaging while at parc kay conceived the dynabook concept a key progenitor of laptop and tablet computers and the ebook he is also the architect of the modern overlapping windowing graphical user interface gui because the dynabook was conceived as an educational platform kay is considered to be one of the first researchers into mobile learning many features of the dynabook concept have been adopted in the design of the one laptop per child educational platform with which kay is actively involved the field of computing is awaiting new revolution to happen according to kay in which educational communities parents and children will not see in it a set of tools invented by douglas engelbart but a medium in the marshall mcluhan sense he wrote as with simulas leading to oop this encounter finally hit me with what the destiny of personal computing really was going to be not a personal dynamic vehicle as in engelbarts metaphor opposed to the ibm railroads but something much more profound a personal dynamic medium with a vehicle one could wait until high school and give drivers ed but if it was a medium it had to extend into the world of childhood recent work and recognition from 1981 to 1984 kay was ataris chief scientist he became an apple fellow in 1984 following the closure of the companys advanced technology group in 1997 he was recruited by his friend bran ferren head of research and development at disney to join walt disney imagineering as a disney fellow he remained there until ferren left to start applied minds inc with imagineer danny hillis leading to the cessation of the fellows program in 2001 he founded viewpoints research institute a nonprofit organization dedicated to children learning and advanced software development for its first ten years kay and his viewpoints group were based at applied minds in glendale california where he and ferren continued to work together on various projects kay was also a senior fellow at hewlettpackard until hp disbanded the advanced software research team on july 20 2005 kay taught a fall 2011 class powerful ideas useful tools to understand the world at new york universitys interactive telecommunications program itp along with fulltime itp faculty member nancy hechinger the goal of the class was to devise new forms of teachinglearning based on fundamental powerful concepts rather than traditional rote learning squeak etoys and croquet in december 1995 while still at apple kay collaborated with many others to start the open source squeak version of smalltalk and he continues to work on it as part of this effort in november 1996 his team began research on what became the etoys system more recently he started along with david a smith david p reed andreas raab rick mcgeer julian lombardi and mark mccahill the croquet project an open source networked 2d and 3d environment for collaborative work tweak in 2001 it became clear that the etoy architecture in squeak had reached its limits in what the morphic interface infrastructure could do andreas raab was a researcher working in kays group then at hewlettpackard he proposed defining a script process and providing a default scheduling mechanism that avoids several more general problems its underlying object system is classbased but to users during programming it acts like it is prototypebased tweak objects are created and run in tweak project windows childrens machine in november 2005 at the world summit on the information society the mit research laboratories unveiled a new laptop computer for educational use around the world it has many names the 100 laptop the one laptop per child program the childrens machine and the xo1 the program was begun and is sustained by kays friend nicholas negroponte and is based on kays dynabook ideal kay is a prominent codeveloper of the computer focusing on its educational software using squeak and etoys reinventing programming kay has lectured extensively on the idea that the computer revolution is very new and all of the good ideas have not been universally implemented lectures at oopsla 1997 conference and his acm turing award talk entitled the computer revolution hasnt happened yet were informed by his experiences with sketchpad simula smalltalk and the bloated code of commercial software on august 31 2006 kays proposal to the united states national science foundation nsf was granted thus funding viewpoints research institute for several years the proposal title was steps toward the reinvention of programming a compact and practical model of personal computing as a selfexploratorium awards and honors alan kay has received many

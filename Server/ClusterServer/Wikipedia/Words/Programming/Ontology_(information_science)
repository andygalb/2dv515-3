information science for the study of the nature of being see ontology information science general aspects information access information architecture information management information retrieval information seeking information society knowledge organization ontology taxonomy philosophy of information science and technology studies related fields and subfields bibliometrics categorization censorship classification computer data storage cultural studies data modeling informatics information technology intellectual freedom intellectual property memory library and information science preservation privacy quantum information science library and information science portalvte in computer science and information science an ontology encompasses a representation formal naming and definition of the categories properties and relations between the concepts data and entities that substantiate one many or all domains every field creates ontologies to limit complexity and organize information into data and knowledge as new ontologies are made their use hopefully improves problem solving within that domain translating research papers within every field is a problem made easier when experts from different countries maintain a controlled vocabulary of jargon between each of their languages since google started an initiative called knowledge graph a substantial amount of research has gone on using the phrase knowledge graph as a generalized term although there is no clear definition for the term knowledge graph it is sometimes used as synonym for ontology unlike ontologies knowledge graphs such as googles knowledge graph and dbpedia often contain large volumes of factual information with less formal semantics in some contexts the term knowledge graph is used to refer to any knowledge base that is represented as a graph etymology ontology etymology the compound word ontology combines onto from the greek on gen ontos ie being that which is which is the present participle of the verb eim ie to be i am and logia ie logical discourse see classical compounds for this type of word formation while the etymology is greek the oldest extant record of the word itself the new latin form ontologia appeared in 1606 in the work ogdoas scholastica by jacob lorhard lorhardus and in 1613 in the lexicon philosophicum by rudolf gckel goclenius the first occurrence in english of ontology as recorded by the oed oxford english dictionary online edition 2008 came in archeologia philosophica nova or new principles of philosophy by gideon harvey overview what ontologies in both information science and philosophy have in common is the attempt to represent entities ideas and events with all their interdependent properties and relations according to a system of categories in both fields there is considerable work on problems of ontology engineering eg quine and kripke in philosophy sowa and guarino in computer science and debates concerning to what extent normative ontology is possible eg foundationalism and coherentism in philosophy bfo and cyc in artificial intelligence applied ontology is considered a spiritual successor to prior work in philosophy however many current efforts are more concerned with establishing controlled vocabularies of narrow domains than first principles the existence of fixed essences or whether enduring objects eg perdurantism and endurantism may be ontologically more primary than processes every field uses ontological assumptions to frame explicit theories research and applications for instance the definition and ontology of economics is a primacy concern in marxist economics an example of economics relying on information science occurs in cases where a simulation or model is intended to enable economic decisions such as determining what capital assets are at risk and by how much see risk management artificial intelligence has retained the most attention regarding applied ontology in subfields like natural language processing within machine translation and knowledge representation but ontology editors are being used often in a range of fields like education without the intent to contribute to ai history metaphysics history artificial intelligence history ontologies arise out of the branch of philosophy known as metaphysics which deals with questions like what exists and what is the nature of reality one of five traditional branches of philosophy metaphysics is concerned with exploring existence through properties entities and relations such as those between particulars and universals intrinsic and extrinsic properties or essence and existence metaphysics has been an ongoing topic of discussion since recorded history since the mid1970s researchers in the field of artificial intelligence ai have recognized that knowledge engineering is the key to building large and powerful ai systems ai researchers argued that they could create new ontologies as computational models that enable certain kinds of automated reasoning which was only marginally successful in the 1980s the ai community began to use the term ontology to refer to both a theory of a modeled world and a component of knowledgebased systems some researchers drawing inspiration from philosophical ontologies viewed computational ontology as a kind of applied philosophy in the early 1990s the widely cited web page and paper toward principles for the design of ontologies used for knowledge sharing by tom gruber attempting to distance ontologies from taxonomies and similar efforts in knowledge modeling that rely on classes and inheritance gruber stated 1993 ontologies are often equated with taxonomic hierarchies of classes class definitions and the subsumption relation but ontologies need not be limited to these forms ontologies are also not limited to conservative definitions that is definitions in the traditional logic sense that only introduce terminology and do not add any knowledge about the world as refinement of grubers definition feilmayr and w 2016 stated an ontology is a formal explicit specification of a shared conceptualization that is characterized by high semantic expressiveness required for increased complexity components ontology components contemporary ontologies share many structural similarities regardless of the language in which they are expressed most ontologies describe individuals instances classes concepts attributes and relations in this section each of these components is discussed in turn common components of ontologies include individuals instances or objects the basic or ground level objects classes sets collections concepts classes in programming types of objects or kinds of things attributes aspects properties features characteristics or parameters that objects and classes can have relations ways in which classes and individuals can be related to one another function terms complex structures formed from certain relations that can be used in place of an individual term in a statement restrictions formally stated descriptions of what must be true in order for some assertion to be accepted as input rules statements in the form of an ifthen antecedentconsequent sentence that describe the logical inferences that can be drawn from an assertion in a particular form axioms assertions including rules in a logical form that together comprise the overall theory that the ontology describes in its domain of application this definition differs from that of axioms in generative grammar and formal logic in those disciplines axioms include only statements asserted as a priori knowledge as used here axioms also include the theory derived from axiomatic statements events the changing of attributes or relations ontologies are commonly encoded using ontology languages types domain ontology a domain ontology or domainspecific ontology represents concepts which belong to a part of the world such as biology or politics each domain ontology typically models domain specific definitions of terms for example the word card has many different meanings an ontology about the domain of poker would model the playing card meaning of the word while an ontology about the domain of computer hardware would model the punched card and video card meanings since domain ontologies are written by different people they represent concepts in very specific and unique ways and are often incompatible within the same project as systems that rely on domain ontologies expand they often need to merge domain ontologies by handtuning each entity or using a combination of software merging and handtuning this presents a challenge to the ontology designer different ontologies in the same domain arise due to different languages different intended usage of the ontologies and different perceptions of the domain based on cultural background education ideology etc at present merging ontologies that are not developed from a common upper ontology is a largely manual process and therefore timeconsuming and expensive domain ontologies that use the same upper ontology to provide a set of basic elements with which to specify the meanings of the domain ontology entities can be merged with less effort there are studies on generalized techniques for merging ontologies but this area of research is still ongoing and its a recent event to see the issue sidestepped by having multiple domain ontologies using the same upper ontology like the obo foundry upper ontology upper ontology an upper ontology or foundation ontology is a model of the common relations and objects that are generally applicable across a wide range of domain ontologies it usually employs a core glossary that contains the terms and associated object descriptions as they are used in various relevant domain ontologies standardized upper ontologies available for use include bfo boro method dublin core gfo opencycresearchcyc sumo umbel the unified foundational ontology ufo hybrid ontology the gellish ontology is an example of a combination of an upper and a domain ontology visualization a survey of ontology visualization techniques is presented by katifori et al engineering ontology engineering ontology engineering also called ontology building is a set of tasks related to the development of ontologies for a particular domain ontology engineering aims to make explicit the knowledge contained in software applications and organizational procedures for a particular domain ontology engineering offers a direction for overcoming semantic obstacles such as those related to the definitions of business terms and software classes known challenges with ontology engineering include ensuring the ontology is current with domain knowledge and term use providing sufficient specificity and concept coverage for the domain of interest thus minimizing the content completeness problem ensuring the ontology can

ontology learning ontology learning is the automatic or semiautomatic creation of ontologies including extracting a domains terms from natural language text as building ontologies manually is extremely laborintensive and time consuming there is great motivation to automate the process information extraction and text mining have been explored to automatically link ontologies to documents

ontologies both proprietary and standardsbased common algebraic specification language is a general logicbased specification language developed within the ifip working group 13 foundations of system

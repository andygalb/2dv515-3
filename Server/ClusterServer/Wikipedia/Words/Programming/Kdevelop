kdevelop kdevelop is a free and opensource integrated development environment ide for unixlike computer operating systems and microsoft windows it provides editing navigation and debugging features for several programming languages and integration with build automation and versioncontrol systems using a pluginbased architecture kdevelop 5 has parser backends for c c objectivec opencl and javascriptqml with plugins supporting php python 3 and ruby basic syntax highlighting and code folding are available for dozens of other sourcecode and markup formats but without semantic analysis kdevelop is part of the kde project and is based on kde frameworks and qt the cc backend uses clang to provide accurate information even for very complex codebases history kdevelop 01 was released in 1998 1x and 2x were developed over a period of four years from the original codebase afaik sandy meier founded it some people from his university helped him ralf nolden has also been a member from the first days in 1998 sandy meier started kdevelop and worked 8 weeks alone on this project since then the kdevelop ide is publicly available under the gpl and supports many programming languages berndnd gehrmann started a complete rewrite and announced kdevelop 3x in march 2001 its first release was together with k desktop environment 32 in february 2004 and development of kdevelop 3x continued until 2008 kdevelop 4x another complete rewrite with a more objectoriented programming model kdevelop 5 development began in august 2014 as a continuation of the 4x codebase ported to qt5 and kde frameworks 5 the custom c parser used in earlier versions which had poor support for c11 syntax was replaced by a new clangbased backend the integrated cmakefile interpreter was also removed in favour of json metadata produced by the upstream cmake tool semantic language support was added for qml and javascript using the parser from qt creator alongside a new qmake projectmanager backend the first stable 5x release was kdevelop 500 in august 2016 features see also kdevelop features tour kdevelop uses an embedded text editor component through the kparts framework the default editor is kde advanced text editor which can optionally be replaced with a qt designerbased editor this list focuses on the features of kdevelop itself for features specific to the editor component see the article on kate source code editor with syntax highlighting and automatic indentation kate cc language is now supported with a clangs backend as of kdevelop50 project management for different project types such as automake cmake qmake for qt based projects and ant for java based projects class browser gui designer frontend for the gnu compiler collection and gnu debugger wizards to generate and update class definitions and application framework automatic code completion cc builtin doxygen support revision control also known as scm support supported systems include cvs subversion perforce clearcase git mercurial and bazaar kdevelop 4 is a completely pluginbased architecture when a developer makes a change they only must compile the plugin there is a possibility to keep several profiles each of which determines which plugins to be loaded kdevelop does not come with a text editor but instead uses a plugin for this purpose as well kdevelop is programming language independent and build systemindependent supporting kde gnome and many other technologies such as qt gtk and wxwidgets kdevelop has supported a variety of programming languages including c c perl python php java fortran ruby ada pascal sql and bash scripting supported build systems include gnu automake cmake qmake and make for custom projects kdevelop does not destroy user makefiles if they are used and scripting projects which dont need one code completion is available for c and c symbols are kept in a berkeley db file for quick lookups without reparsing kdevelop also offers a developer framework which helps to write new parsers for other programming languages an integrated debugger allows graphically doing all debugging with breakpoints and backtraces it even works with dynamically loaded plugins unlike command line gdb quick open allows quick navigation between files currently around 50 to 100 plugins exist for this ide major ones include persistent projectwide code bookmarks code abbreviations which allow expanding text quickly a source formatter which reformats code to a style guide before saving regular expressions search and projectwide searchreplace which helps in refactoring code free software portal

equipped with an omnifont software that enabled optical character recognition for numeric inputs the digitization projects could then be a lot more ambitious since the time needed for digitization decreased considerably and digital libraries are be on the rise all over the world elibraries start to emerge the abu association des bibliophiles universels was a public digital library project

cards on millions of digital objects and links to their digital libraries electronic publishing the first digitization projects were transferring physical content into digital content electronic publishing is aiming to integrate the whole process of editing and publishing production layout publication in the digital world alain mille in the book pratiques de ldition numrique edited by michael e sinatra and marcello vitalirosati the traditional publishing and especially the creation part were first revolutionized by new desktop publishing softwares appearing in the 1980s and by the text databases created for the encyclopedias and directories at the same time the multimedia was developing quickly combining book audiovisual and computer science characteristics cds and dvds appear permitting the visualization of these dictionaries and encyclopedias on computers the arrival and democratization of internet is slowly giving small publishing houses the opportunity to publish their books directly online some websites like amazon let their users buy ebooks internet users can also find many educative platforms free or not encyclopedic websites like wikipedia and even digital magazines platforms the ebook then becomes more and more accessible through many different supports like the ereader and even smartphones the digital book had and still has an important impact on publishing houses and their economical models it is still a moving domain and they yet have to master the new ways of publishing in a digital era online edition based on new communications practices of the web 20 and the new architecture of participation online edition opens the door to a collaboration of a community to elaborate and improve contents on internet while also enriching reading through collective reading practices the web 20 not only links documents together as did the web 10 it also links people together through social media thats why its called the participative or participatory web many tools were put in place to foster sharing and creative collective contents one of the many is the wikipedia encyclopedia since it is edited corrected and enhanced by millions of contributors open street map is also based on the same principle blogs and comment systems are also now renown as online edition and publishing since it is possible through new interactions between the author and its readers and can be an important method for inspiration but also for visibility process the electronic publishing process follows some aspects of the traditional paperbased publishing process but differs from traditional publishing in two ways 1 it does not include using an offset printing press to print the final product and 2 it avoids the distribution of a physical product eg paper books paper magazines or paper newspapers because the content is electronic it may be distributed over the internet and through electronic bookstores and users can read the material on a range of electronic and digital devices including desktop computers laptops tablet computers smartphones or ereader tablets the consumer may read the published content online a website in an application on a tablet device or in a pdf document on a computer in some cases the reader may print the content onto paper using a consumergrade inkjet or laser printer or via a print on demand system some users download digital content to their devices enabling them to read the content even when their device is not connected to the internet eg on an airplane flight distributing content electronically as software applications apps has become popular in the 2010s due to the rapid consumer adoption of smartphones and tablets at first native apps for each mobile platform were required to reach all audiences but in an effort toward universal device compatibility attention has turned to using html5 to create web apps that can run on any browser and function on many devices the benefit of electronic publishing comes from using three attributes of digital technology xml tags to define content style sheets to define the look of content and metadata data about data to describe the content for search engines thus helping users to find and locate the content a common example of metadata is the information about a songs songwriter composer genre that is electronically encoded along with most cds and digital audio files this metadata makes it easier for music lovers to find the songs they are looking for with the use of tags style sheets and metadata this enables reflowable content that adapts to various reading devices tablet smartphone ereader etc or electronic delivery methods because electronic publishing often requires text markup eg hyper text markup language or some other markup language to develop online delivery methods the traditional roles of typesetters and book designers who created the printing setups for paper books have changed designers of digitally published content must have a strong knowledge of markup languages the variety of reading devices and computers available and the ways in which consumers read view or access the content however in the 2010s new user friendly design software is becoming available for designers to publish content in this standard without needing to know detailed programming techniques such as adobe systems digital publishing suite and apples ibooks author the most common file format is epub used in many ebook formats epub is a free and open standard available in many publishing programs another common format is folio which is used by the adobe digital publishing suite to create content for apples ipad tablets and apps academic publishing academic publishing see also eprint after an article is submitted to an academic journal for consideration there can be a delay ranging from several months to more than two years because when a journal is available online a larger number of researchers can access the journal even if a professor is working in a university that does not have a certain journal in its library she may still be able to access the journal online a number of journals have while retaining their longstanding peer review process to ensure that the research is done properly established electronic versions or even moved entirely to electronic publication copyright in the early 2000s many of the existing copyright laws were designed around printed books magazines and newspapers for example copyright laws often set limits on how much of a book can be mechanically reproduced or copied electronic publishing raises new questions in relation to copyright because if an ebook or ejournal is available online millions of internet users may be able to view a single electronic copy of the document without any copies being made emerging evidence suggests that epublishing may be more collaborative than traditional paperbased publishing epublishing often involves more than one author and the resulting works are more accessible since they are published online at the same time the availability of published material online opens more doors for plagiarism unauthorized use or reuse of the material other publishers such as penguin are attempting to incorporate ebook elements into their regular paper publications examples electronic versions of

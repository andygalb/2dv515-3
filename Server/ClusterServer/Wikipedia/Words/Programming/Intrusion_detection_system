software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations any malicious activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management siem system a siem system combines outputs from multiple sources and uses alarm filtering techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarms ids types range in scope from single computers to large networks comparison with firewalls although they both relate to network security an ids differs from a firewall in that a firewall looks outwardly for intrusions in order to stop them from happening firewalls limit access between networks to prevent intrusion and do not signal an attack from inside the network an ids describes a suspected intrusion once it has taken place and signals an alarm an ids also watches for attacks that originate from within a system this is traditionally achieved by examining network communications identifying heuristics and patterns often known as signatures of common computer attacks and taking action to alert operators a system that terminates connections is called an intrusion prevention system and is another form of an application layer firewall intrusion detection ids can be classified by where detection takes place network or host and the detection method that is employed for ids related to wireless sensor networks wsns readers may refer to butun et als work analyzed activity network intrusion detection systems network intrusion detection systems nids are placed at a strategic point or points within the network to monitor traffic to and from all devices on the network it performs an analysis of passing traffic on the entire subnet and matches the traffic that is passed on the subnets to the library of known attacks once an attack is identified or abnormal behavior is sensed the alert can be sent to the administrator an example of an nids would be installing it on the subnet where firewalls are located in order to see if someone is trying to break into the firewall ideally one would scan all inbound and outbound traffic however doing so might create a bottleneck that would impair the overall speed of the network opnet and netsim are commonly used tools for simulating network intrusion detection systems nid systems are also capable of comparing signatures for similar packets to link and drop harmful detected packets which have a signature matching the records in the nids when we classify the design of the nids according to the system interactivity property there are two types online and offline nids often referred to as inline and tap mode respectively online nids deals with the network in real time it analyses the ethernet packets and applies some rules to decide if it is an attack or not offline nids deals with stored data and passes it through some processes to decide if it is an attack or not host intrusion detection systems hostbased intrusion detection system host intrusion detection systems hids run on individual hosts or devices on the network a hids monitors the inbound and outbound packets from the device only and will alert the user or administrator if suspicious activity is detected it takes a snapshot of existing system files and matches it to the previous snapshot if the critical system files were modified or deleted an alert is sent to the administrator to investigate an example of hids usage can be seen on mission critical machines which are not expected to change their configurations intrusion detection systems can also be systemspecific using custom tools and honeypots detection method signaturebased signaturebased ids refers to the detection of attacks by looking for specific patterns such as byte sequences in network traffic or known malicious instruction sequences used by malware this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it july 2016 in signaturebased ids the signatures are released by a vendor for its all products ontime updation of the ids with the signature is a key aspect anomalybased anomalybased intrusion detection systems were primarily introduced to detect unknown attacks in part due to the rapid development of malware the basic approach is to use machine learning to create a model of trustworthy activity and then compare new behavior against this model although this approach enables the detection of previously unknown attacks it may suffer from false positives previously unknown legitimate activity may also be classified as malicious most of the existing idss suffer from the timeconsuming during detection process that degrades the performance of idss efficient feature selection algorithm makes the classification process used in detection more reliable new types of what could be called anomalybased intrusion detection systems are being viewed by gartner as user and entity behavior analytics ueba this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it july 2016 intrusion prevention some systems may attempt to stop an intrusion attempt but this is neither required nor expected of a monitoring system intrusion detection and prevention systems idps are primarily focused on identifying possible incidents logging information about them and reporting attempts in addition organizations use idps for other purposes such as identifying problems with security policies documenting existing threats and deterring individuals from violating security policies idps have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization idps typically record information related to observed events notify security administrators of important observed events and produce reports many idps can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding they use several response techniques which involve the idps stopping the attack itself changing the security environment eg reconfiguring a firewall or changing the attacks content intrusion prevention systems ips also known as intrusion detection and prevention systems idps are network security appliances that monitor network or system activities for malicious activity the main functions of intrusion prevention systems are to identify malicious activity log information about this activity report it and attempt to block or stop it intrusion prevention systems are considered extensions of intrusion detection systems because they both monitor network traffic andor system activities for malicious activity the main differences are unlike intrusion detection systems intrusion prevention systems are placed inline and are able to actively prevent or block intrusions that are detected classification intrusion prevention systems can be classified into four different types networkbased intrusion prevention system nips monitors the entire network for suspicious traffic by analyzing protocol activity wireless intrusion prevention system wips monitor a wireless network for suspicious traffic by analyzing wireless networking protocols network behavior analysis nba examines network traffic to identify threats that generate unusual traffic flows such as distributed denial of service ddos attacks certain forms of malware and policy violations hostbased intrusion prevention system hips an installed software package which monitors a single host for suspicious activity by analyzing events occurring within that host detection methods the majority of intrusion prevention systems utilize one of three detection methods signaturebased statistical anomalybased and stateful protocol analysis signaturebased detection signaturebased ids monitors packets in the network and compares with preconfigured and predetermined attack patterns known as signatures statistical anomalybased detection an ids which is anomalybased will monitor network traffic and compare it against an established baseline the baseline will identify what is normal for that network what sort of bandwidth is generally used and what protocols are used it may however raise a false positive alarm for legitimate use of bandwidth if the baselines are not intelligently configured stateful protocol analysis detection this method identifies deviations of protocol states by comparing observed events with predetermined profiles of generally accepted definitions of benign activity limitations noise can severely limit an intrusion detection systems effectiveness bad packets generated from software bugs corrupt dns data and local packets that escaped can create a significantly high falsealarm rate it is not uncommon for the number of real attacks to be far below the number of falsealarms number of real attacks is often so far below the number of falsealarms that the real attacks are often missed and ignored many attacks are geared for specific versions of software that are usually outdated a constantly changing library of signatures is needed to mitigate threats outdated signature databases can leave the ids vulnerable to newer strategies for signaturebased ids there will be lag between a new threat discovery and its signature being applied to the ids during this lag time the ids will be unable to identify the threat it cannot compensate for weak identification and authentication mechanisms or for weaknesses in network protocols when an attacker gains access due to weak authentication mechanisms then ids cannot prevent the adversary from any malpractice encrypted packets are not processed by most intrusion detection devices therefore the encrypted packet can allow an intrusion to the network that is undiscovered until more significant network intrusions have occurred intrusion detection software provides information based on the network address that is associated with the ip packet that is sent into the network this is beneficial if the network address contained in the ip packet is accurate however the address that is contained in the ip packet could be faked or scrambled due to the nature of nids systems and the need for them to analyse protocols as they are captured nids systems can be susceptible to the same protocolbased attacks to which network hosts may be vulnerable invalid data and tcpip stack attacks may cause an nids to crash evasion techniques intrusion detection system evasion techniques there are a number of techniques which attackers are using the following are considered simple measures which can be taken to evade ids fragmentation by sending fragmented packets the attacker will be under the radar and can easily bypass the detection systems ability to detect the attack signature avoiding defaults the tcp port utilised by a protocol does not always provide an indication to the protocol which is being transported for example an ids may expect to detect a trojan on port 12345 if an attacker had reconfigured it to use a different port the ids may not be able to detect the presence of the trojan coordinated lowbandwidth attacks coordinating a scan among numerous attackers or agents and allocating different ports or hosts to different attackers makes it difficult for the ids to correlate the captured packets and deduce that a network scan is in progress address spoofingproxying attackers can increase the difficulty of the security administrators ability to determine the source of the attack by using poorly secured or incorrectly configured proxy servers to bounce an attack if the source is spoofed and bounced by a server it makes it very difficult for ids to detect the origin of the attack pattern change evasion ids generally rely on pattern matching to detect an attack by changing the data used in the attack slightly it may be possible to evade detection for example an internet message access protocol imap server may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow and an ids is able to detect the attack signature of 10 common attack tools by modifying the payload sent by the tool so that it does not resemble the data that the ids expects it may be possible to evade detection development the earliest preliminary ids concept was delineated in 1980 by james anderson at the national security agency and consisted of a set of tools intended to help administrators review audit trails user access logs file access logs and system event logs are examples of audit trails fred cohen noted in 1987 that it is impossible to detect an intrusion in every case and that the resources needed to detect intrusions grow with the amount of usage dorothy e denning assisted by peter g neumann published a model of an ids in 1986 that formed the basis for many systems today the multics intrusion detection and alerting system midas an expert system using pbest and lisp was developed in 1988 based on the work of denning and neumann in 1986 the national security agency started an ids research transfer program under rebecca bace bace later published the seminal text on the subject intrusion detection in 2000 wisdom sense ws was a statisticsbased anomaly detector developed in 1989 at the los alamos national laboratory ws created rules based on statistical analysis and then used those rules for anomaly detection in 1990 the timebased inductive machine tim did anomaly detection using inductive learning of sequential user patterns in common lisp on a vax 3500 computer then in 1991 researchers at the university of california davis created a prototype distributed intrusion detection system dids which was also an expert system nadir used a statisticsbased anomaly detector and an expert system the lawrence berkeley national laboratory announced bro in 1998 which used its own rule language for packet analysis from libpcap data ape was developed as a packet sniffer also using libpcap in november 1998 and was renamed snort one month later snort has since become the worlds largest used idsips system with over 300000 active users it can monitor both local systems and remote capture points using the tzsp protocol the audit data analysis and mining adam ids in 2001 used tcpdump to build profiles of rules for classifications in

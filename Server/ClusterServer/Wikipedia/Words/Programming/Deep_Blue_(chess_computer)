deep blue (chess computer) deep blue at the computer history museum deep blue was a chessplaying computer developed by ibm it is known for being the first computer chessplaying system to win both a chess game and a chess match against a reigning world champion under regular time controls deep blue won its first game against a world champion on 10 february 1996 when it defeated garry kasparov in game one of a sixgame match however kasparov won three and drew two of the following five games defeating deep blue by a score of 42 deep blue was then heavily upgraded and played kasparov again in may 1997 development for deep blue began in 1985 with the chiptest project at carnegie mellon university this project eventually evolved into deep thought at which point the development team was hired by ibm the project evolved once more with the new name deep blue in 1989 grandmaster joel benjamin was also part of the development team origins the project was started as chiptest at carnegie mellon university by fenghsiung hsu followed by its successor deep thought after their graduation from carnegie mellon hsu thomas anantharaman and murray campbell from the deep thought team were hired by ibm research to continue their quest to build a chess machine that could defeat the world champion the team was managed first by randy moulic followed by chungjen c j tan after deep thoughts 1989 match against kasparov ibm held a contest to rename the chess machine and it became deep blue a play on ibms nickname big blue in 1995 deep blue prototype actually deep thought ii renamed for pr reasons played in the 8th world computer chess championship deep blue prototype played the computer program wchess to a draw while wchess was running on a personal computer in round 5 deep blue prototype had the white pieces and lost to the computer program fritz 3 in 39 moves while fritz was running on an intel pentium 90mhz personal computer in the end of the championship deep blue prototype was tied for second place with the computer program junior while junior was running on a personal computer design deep blue employed custom vlsi chips to execute the alphabeta search algorithm in parallel deep blue versus kasparov deep blue versus garry kasparov deep blue and kasparov played each other on two occasions the first match began on 10 february 1996 in which deep blue became the first machine to win a chess game against a reigning world champion garry kasparov under regular time controls however kasparov won three and drew two of the following five games beating deep blue by a score of 42 wins count 1 point draws count point the match concluded on 17 february 1996 deep blue was then heavily upgraded unofficially nicknamed deeper blue and played kasparov again in may 1997 winning the sixgame rematch 32 ending on 11 may deep blue won the deciding game six after kasparov made a mistake in the opening becoming the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in a match under standard chess tournament time controls the system derived its playing strength mainly from brute force computing power it was a massively parallel rs6000 sp thin p2scbased system with 30 nodes with each node containing a 120mhz p2sc microprocessor enhanced with 480 special purpose vlsi chess chips its chess playing program was written in c and ran under the aix operating system it was capable of evaluating 200 million positions per second twice as fast as the 1996 version in june 1997 deep blue was the 259th most powerful supercomputer according to the top500 list achieving 1138 gflops on the highperformance linpack benchmark the deep blue chess computer that defeated kasparov in 1997 would typically search to a depth of between six and eight moves to a maximum of twenty or even more moves in some situations kasparov in 1985 deep blues evaluation function was initially written in a generalized form with many tobedetermined parameters eg how important is a safe king position compared to a space advantage in the center etc the optimal values for these parameters were then determined by the system itself by analyzing thousands of master games the evaluation function had been split into 8000 parts many of them designed for special positions in the opening book there were over 4000 positions and 700000 grandmaster games the endgame database contained many six piece endgames and five or fewer piece positions before the second match the chess knowledge of the program was fine tuned by grandmaster joel benjamin the opening library was provided by grandmasters miguel illescas john fedorowicz and nick de firmian writer nate silver suggests that a bug in deep blues software led to a seemingly random move the 44th in the first game of the second match which kasparov misattributed to superior intelligence aftermath computer scientists believed that playing chess was a good measurement for the effectiveness of artificial intelligence and by beating a world champion chess player ibm showed that they had made significant progress after the loss kasparov said that he sometimes saw deep intelligence and creativity in the machines moves suggesting that during the second game human chess players had intervened on behalf of the machine which would be a violation of the rules ibm denied that it cheated saying the only human intervention occurred between games the rules provided for the developers to modify the program between games an opportunity they said they used to shore up weaknesses in the computers play that were revealed during the course of the match kasparov requested printouts of the machines log files but ibm refused although the company later published the logs on the internet in 2003 a documentary film was made that explored these claims entitled game over kasparov and the machine the film interviewed some people who suggest that deep blues victory was a ploy by ibm to boost its stock value one of the cultural impacts of deep blue was the creation of a new game called arimaa designed to be much more difficult for computers than chess one of the two racks that made up deep blue is on display at the national museum of american history in their exhibit about the information age fenghsiung hsu later claimed in his book behind deep blue that he had the rights to use the deep blue design to build a bigger machine independently of ibm to take kasparovs rematch offer but kasparov refused a rematch deep blue with its capability of evaluating 200 million positions per second was the fastest computer to face a world chess champion today in computer chess research and matches of world class players against computers the focus of play has often shifted to software chess programs rather than using dedicated chess hardware modern chess programs like houdini rybka deep fritz or deep junior are more efficient than the programs during deep blues era in a november 2006 match between deep fritz and world chess champion vladimir kramnik the program ran on a computer system containing a dualcore intel xeon 5160 cpu capable of evaluating only 8 million positions per second but searching to an average depth of 17 to 18 plies in the middlegame thanks to heuristics it won 42 alphago anticomputer tactics arimaa artificial intelligence deep blue kasparov 1996 game 1 deep blue kasparov 1997 game

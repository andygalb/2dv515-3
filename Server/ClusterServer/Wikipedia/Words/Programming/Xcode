programming languages c c objectivec objectivec java applescript python ruby resedit rez and swift with a variety of programming models including but not limited to cocoa carbon and java third parties have added support for gnu pascal xcode can build fat binary files containing code for multiple architectures with the macho executable format these are called universal binary files which allow software to run on both powerpc and intelbased x86 platforms and that can include both 32bit and 64bit code for both architectures using the ios sdk xcode can also be used to compile and debug applications for ios that run on arm architecture processors xcode includes the gui tool instruments which runs atop a dynamic tracing framework dtrace created by sun microsystems and released as part of opensolaris composition the main application of the suite is the integrated development environment ide also named xcode the xcode suite includes most of apples developer documentation and builtin interface builder an application used to construct graphical user interfaces up to xcode 41 the xcode suite included a modified version of the gnu compiler collection in xcode 31 up to xcode 463 it included the llvmgcc compiler with front ends from the gnu compiler collection and a code generator based on llvm starting with xcode 50 clang was the only compiler provided up to xcode 463 the xcode suite used the gnu debugger gdb as the backend for the ides debugger starting with xcode 43 the lldb debugger was also provided starting with xcode 45 lldb replaced gdb as the default backend for the ides debugger removed features formerly xcode supported distributing a product build process over multiple systems one technology involved was named shared workgroup build which used the bonjour

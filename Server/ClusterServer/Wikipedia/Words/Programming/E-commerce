mcommerce mobile commerce as well around 2013 tcommerce have also been used global trends in 2010 the united kingdom had the highest per capita ecommerce spending in the world among emerging economies chinas ecommerce presence continues to expand every year with 668 million internet users chinas online shopping sales reached 253 billion in the first half of 2015 accounting for 10 of total chinese consumer retail sales in that period recent research clearly indicates that electronic commerce commonly referred to as ecommerce presently shapes the manner in which people shop for products the gcc countries have a rapidly growing market and characterized by a population that becomes wealthier yuldashev as such retailers have launched arabiclanguage websites as a means to target this population secondly there are predictions of increased mobile purchases and an expanding internet audience yuldashev the growth and development of the two aspects make the gcc countries to become larger players in the electronic commerce market with time progress specifically research shows that ecommerce market is expected to grow to over 20 billion by the year 2020 among these gcc countries yuldashev the ecommerce market has also gained much popularity among the western countries and in particular europe and the us these countries have been highly characterized with consumerpackagedgoods cpg geisler 34 however trends show that there are future signs of a reverse similar to the gcc countries there has been increased purchase of goods and services in online channels rather than offline channels activist investors are trying hard to consolidate and slash their overall cost and the governments in western countries continue to impose more regulation on cpg manufacturers geisler 36 in these senses cpg investors are being forced to adapt ecommerce as it is effective as a well as a means for them to thrive in 2013 brazils ecommerce was growing quickly with retail ecommerce sales expected to grow at a doubledigit pace through 2014 by 2016 emarketer expected retail ecommerce sales in brazil to reach 173 billion the future trends in the gcc countries will be similar with that of the western countries despite the forces that push business to adapt ecommerce as a means to sell goods and products the manner in which customers make purchases is similar in countries from these two regions for instance there has been an increased usage of smartphones which comes in conjunction with an increase in the overall internet audience from the regions yuldashev writes that consumers are scaling up to more modern technology that allows for mobile marketing however the percentage of smartphone and internet users who make online purchases is expected to vary in the first few years it will be independent on the willingness of the people to adopt this new trend the statistics portal for example uae has the greatest smartphone penetration of 738 percent and has 919 percent of its population has access to the internet on the other hand smartphone penetration in europe has been reported to be at 647 percent the statistics portal regardless the disparity in percentage between these regions is expected to level out in future because ecommerce technology is expected to grow allowing for more users the ecommerce business within these two regions will result in a competition government bodies at country level will enhance their measures and strategies to ensure sustainability and consumer protection krings et al these increased measures will raise the environmental and social standards in the countries factors that will determine the success of ecommerce market in these countries for example an adoption of tough sanctions will make it difficult for companies to enter the ecommerce market while lenient sanctions will allow ease of companies as such the future trends between gcc countries and the western countries will be independent of these sanctions krings et al these countries need to make rational conclusions in coming up with effective sanctions the rate of growth of the number of internet users in the arab countries has been rapid 131 in 2015 a significant portion of the ecommerce market in the middle east comprises people in the 3034 year age group egypt has the largest number of internet users in the region followed by saudi arabia and morocco these constitute 34th of the regions share yet internet penetration is low 35 in egypt and 65 in saudi arabia ecommerce has become an important tool for small and large businesses worldwide not only to sell to customers but also to engage them in 2012 ecommerce sales topped 1 trillion for the first time in history mobile devices are playing an increasing role in the mix of ecommerce this is also commonly called mobile commerce or mcommerce in 2014 one estimate saw purchases made on mobile devices making up 25 of the market by 2017 for traditional businesses one research stated that information technology and crossborder ecommerce is a good opportunity for the rapid development and growth of enterprises many companies have invested enormous volume of investment in mobile applications the delone and mclean model stated that three perspectives contribute to a successful ebusiness information system quality service quality and users satisfaction modern 3d graphics technologies such as facebook 3d posts are considered by some social media marketers and advertisers as a more preferable way to promote consumer goods than static photos and some brands like sony are already paving the way for augmented reality commerce wayfair now lets you inspect a 3d version of its furniture in a home setting before buying logistics logistics in ecommerce mainly concerns fulfillment online markets and retailers have to find the best possible way to fill orders and deliver products small companies usually control their own logistic operation because they do not have the ability to hire an outside company most large companies hire a fulfillment service that takes care of a companys logistic needs contrary to common misconception there are significant barriers to entry in ecommerce impact on markets and retailers store closing flags outside a toys r us in new jersey despite investments the chain struggled to win market share in the age of digital commerce ecommerce markets are growing at noticeable rates the online market is expected to grow by 56 in 20152020 traditional markets are only expected 2 growth during the same time brick and mortar retailers are struggling because of online retailers ability to offer lower prices and higher efficiency many larger retailers are able to maintain a presence offline and online by linking physical and online offerings ecommerce allows customers to overcome geographical barriers and allows them to purchase products anytime and from anywhere online and traditional markets have different strategies for conducting business traditional retailers offer fewer assortment of products because of shelf space where online retailers often hold no inventory but send customer orders directly to the manufacture the pricing strategies are also different for traditional and online retailers traditional retailers base their prices on store traffic and the cost to keep inventory online retailers base prices on the speed of delivery there are two ways for marketers to conduct business through ecommerce fully online or online along with a brick and mortar store online marketers can offer lower prices greater product selection and high efficiency rates many customers prefer online markets if the products can be delivered quickly at relatively low price however online retailers cannot offer the physical experience that traditional retailers can it can be difficult to judge the quality of a product without the physical experience which may cause customers to experience product or seller uncertainty another issue regarding the online market is concerns about the security of online transactions many customers remain loyal to wellknown retailers because of this issue security is a primary problem for ecommerce in developed and developing countries ecommerce security is protecting business websites and costumers from unauthorized access use alteration or destruction the type of threats include malicious codes unwanted programs ad ware spyware phishing hacking and cyber vandalism ecommerce websites use different tools to avert security threats these tools include firewalls encryption software digital certificates and passwords impact on supply chain management supply chain management for a long time companies had been troubled by the gap between the benefits which supply chain technology has and the solutions to deliver those benefits however the emergence of ecommerce has provided a more practical and effective way of delivering the benefits of the new supply chain technologies ecommerce has the capability to integrate all intercompany and intracompany functions meaning that the three flows physical flow financial flow and information flow of the supply chain could be also affected by ecommerce the affections on physical flows improved the way of product and inventory movement level for companies for the information flows ecommerce optimised the capacity of information processing than companies used to have and for the financial flows ecommerce allows companies to have more efficient payment and settlement solutions in addition ecommerce has a more sophisticated level of impact on supply chains firstly the performance gap will be eliminated since companies can identify gaps between different levels of supply chains by electronic means of solutions secondly as a result of ecommerce emergence new capabilities such implementing erp systems like sap erp xero or megaventory have helped companies to manage operations with customers and suppliers yet these new capabilities are still not fully exploited thirdly technology companies would keep investing on new ecommerce software solutions as they are expecting investment return fourthly ecommerce would help to solve many aspects of issues that companies may feel difficult to cope with such as political barriers or crosscountry changes finally ecommerce provides companies a more efficient and effective way to collaborate with each other within the supply chain impact on employment ecommerce helps create new job opportunities due to information related services software app and digital products it also causes job losses the areas with the greatest predicted jobloss are retail postal and travel agencies the development of ecommerce will create jobs that require highly skilled workers to manage large amounts of information customer demands and production processes in contrast people with poor technical skills cannot enjoy the wages welfare on the other hand because ecommerce requires sufficient stocks that could be delivered to customers in time the warehouse becomes an important element warehouse needs more staff to manage supervise and organize thus the condition of warehouse environment will be concerned by employees impact on customers ecommerce brings convenience for customers as they do not have to leave home and only need to browse website online especially for buying the products which are not sold in nearby shops it could help customers buy wider range of products and save customers time consumers also gain power through online shopping they are able to research products and compare prices among retailers also online shopping often provides sales promotion or discounts code thus it is more price effective for customers moreover ecommerce provides products detailed information even the instore staff cannot offer such detailed explanation customers can also review and track the order history online ecommerce technologies cut transaction costs by allowing both manufactures and consumers to skip through the intermediaries this is achieved through by extending the search area best price deals and by group purchase the success of ecommerce in urban and regional levels depend on how the local firms and consumers have adopted to ecommerce however ecommerce lacks human interaction for customers especially who prefer facetoface connection customers are also concerned with the security of online transactions and tend to remain loyal to wellknown retailers distribution channels ecommerce has grown in importance as companies have adopted pureclick and brickandclick channel systems we can distinguish pureclick and brickandclick channel system adopted by companies pureclick or pureplay companies are those that have launched a website without any previous existence as a firm bricksandclicks companies are those existing companies that have added an online site for ecommerce clicktobrick online retailers that later open physical locations to supplement their online efforts types of digital channels ecommerce may take place on retailers web sites or mobile apps or those of ecommerce marketplaces such as on amazon or tmall from alibaba those channels may also be supported by conversational commerce eg live chat or chatbots on web sites conversational commerce may also be standalone such as live chat or chatbots on messaging apps recommendation the contemporary ecommerce trend recommends companies to shift the traditional business model where focus on standardized products homogeneous market and long product life cycle to the new business model where focus on varied and customized products ecommerce requires the company to have the ability to satisfy multiple needs of different customers and provide them with wider range of products with more choices of products the information of products for customers to select and meet their needs become crucial in order to address the mass customization principle to the company the use of recommender system is suggested this system helps recommend the proper products to the customers and helps customers make the decision during the purchasing process the recommender system could be operated through the top sellers on the website the demographics of customers or the consumers buying behavior however there are 3 main ways of recommendations recommending products to customers directly providing detailed products information and showing other buyers opinions or critiques it is benefit for consumer experience without physical shopping in general recommender system is used to contact customers online and assist finding the right products they want effectively and directly information technology

artificial intelligence computer science electrical and electronics engineering vte agile software development is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of selforganizing and crossfunctional teams and their customersend users the term agile sometimes written agile there is significant anecdotal evidence that adopting agile practices and values improves the agility of software professionals teams and organizations however some empirical studies have found no scientific evidence history iterative and incremental development methods can be traced back as early as 1957 during the 1990s a number of lightweight software development methods evolved in reaction to the prevailing heavyweight methods that critics described as overly regulated planned and micromanaged these included rapid application development rad from 1991 in 2001 seventeen software developers met at a resort in snowbird utah to discuss these lightweight development methods including among others kent beck ward cunningham jeff sutherland ken schwaber jim highsmith alistair cockburn and bob martin together they published the manifesto for agile software development in 2005 a group headed by cockburn and highsmith wrote an addendum of project management principles the pm declaration of interdependence to guide software project management according to agile software development methods in 2009 a group working with martin wrote an extension of software development principles the software craftsmanship manifesto to guide agile software development according to professional conduct and mastery in 2011 the agile alliance created the guide to agile practices renamed the agile glossary in 2016 an evolving opensource compendium of the working definitions of agile practices terms and elements along with interpretations and experience guidelines from the worldwide community of agile practitioners the manifesto for agile software development agile software development values based on their combined experience of developing software and helping others do that the seventeen signatories to the manifesto proclaimed that they value individuals and interactions over processes and tools working software over comprehensive documentation customer collaboration over contract negotiation responding to change over following a plan that is to say the items on the left are valued more than the items on the right as scott ambler elucidated tools and processes are important but it is more important to have competent people working together effectively good documentation is useful in helping people to understand how the software is built and how to use it but the main point of development is to create software not documentation a contract is important but is no substitute for working closely with customers to discover what they need a project plan is important but it must not be too rigid to accommodate changes in technology or the environment stakeholders priorities and peoples understanding of the problem and its solution some of the authors formed the agile alliance a nonprofit organization that promotes software development according to the manifestos values and principles introducing the manifesto on behalf of the agile alliance jim highsmith said mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em

to the word methodology we want to restore a balance we embrace modeling but not in order to file some diagram in a dusty corporate repository we embrace documentation but not hundreds of pages of nevermaintained and rarelyused tomes we plan but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment those who would brand proponents of xp or scrum or any of the other agile methodologies as hackers are ignorant of both the methodologies and the original definition of the term hackerjim highsmith history the agile manifesto agile software development principles the manifesto for agile software development is based on twelve principles customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software welcome changing requirements even in late development working software is delivered frequently weeks rather than months close daily cooperation between business people and developers projects are built around motivated individuals who should be trusted facetoface conversation is the best form of communication colocation working software is the primary measure of progress sustainable development able to maintain a constant pace continuous attention to technical excellence and good design simplicitythe art of maximizing the amount of work not doneis essential best architectures requirements and designs emerge from selforganizing teams regularly the team reflects on how to become more effective and adjusts accordingly overview pair programming an agile development technique used by xp note information radiators in the background iterative incremental and evolutionary most agile development methods break product development work into small increments that minimize the amount of upfront planning and design iterations or sprints are short time frames timeboxes that typically last from one to four weeks each iteration involves a crossfunctional team working in all functions planning analysis design coding unit testing and acceptance testing at the end of the iteration a working product is demonstrated to stakeholders this minimizes overall risk and allows the product to adapt to changes quickly efficient and facetoface communication the principle of colocation is that coworkers on the same team should be situated together to better establish the identity as a team and to improve communication no matter which development method is followed every team should include a customer representative product owner in scrum this person is agreed by stakeholders to act on their behalf and makes a personal commitment to being available for developers to answer questions throughout the iteration at the end of each iteration stakeholders and the customer representative review progress and reevaluate priorities with a view to optimizing the return on investment roi and ensuring alignment with customer needs and company goals in agile software development an information radiator is a normally large physical display located prominently near the development team where passersby can see it it presents an uptodate summary of the product development status a build light indicator may also be used to inform a team about the current status of their product development very short feedback loop and adaptation cycle a common characteristic in agile software development is the daily standup also known as the daily scrum in a brief session team members report to each other what they did the previous day toward their teams iteration goal what they intend to do today toward the goal and any roadblocks or impediments they can see to the goal quality focus specific tools and techniques such as continuous integration automated unit testing pair programming testdriven development design patterns behaviordriven development domaindriven design code refactoring and other techniques are often used to improve quality and enhance product development agility philosophy compared to traditional software engineering agile software development mainly targets complex systems and product development with dynamic nondeterministic and nonlinear characteristics accurate estimates stable plans and predictions are often hard to get in early stages and confidence in them is likely to be low agile practitioners will seek to reduce the leapoffaith that is needed before any evidence of value can be obtained adaptive vs predictive development methods exist on a continuum from adaptive to predictive adaptive methods focus on adapting quickly to changing realities when the needs of a project change an adaptive team changes as well an adaptive team has difficulty describing exactly what will happen in the future the further away a date is the more vague an adaptive method is about what will happen on that date an adaptive team cannot report exactly what tasks they will do next week but only which features they plan for next month when asked about a release six months from now an adaptive team might be able to report only the mission statement for the release or a statement of expected value vs cost predictive methods in contrast focus on analysing and planning the future in detail and cater for known risks in the extremes a predictive team can report exactly what features and tasks are planned for the entire length of the development process predictive methods rely on effective early phase analysis and if this goes very wrong the project may have difficulty changing direction predictive teams often institute a change control board to ensure they consider only the most valuable changes risk analysis can be used to choose between adaptive agile or valuedriven and predictive plandriven methods home grounds of different development methods valuedriven methods plandriven methods formal methods low criticality high criticality extreme criticality senior developers junior developers senior developers requirements change often requirements do not change often limited requirements limited features see wirths law small number of developers large number of developers requirements that can be modeled culture that responds to change culture that demands order extreme quality iterative vs waterfall one of the differences between agile software development methods and waterfall is the approach to quality and testing in the waterfall model there is always a separate testing phase after a build phase however in agile software development testing is completed in the same iteration as programming because testing is done in every iterationwhich develops a small piece of the softwareusers can frequently use those new pieces of software and validate the value after the users know the real value of the updated piece of software they can make better decisions about the softwares future having a value retrospective and software replanning session in each iterationscrum typically has iterations of just two weekshelps the team continuously adapt its plans so as to maximize the value it delivers this follows a pattern similar to the pdca cycle as the work is planned done checked in the review and retrospective and any changes agreed are acted upon this iterative approach supports a product rather than a project mindset this provides greater flexibility throughout the development process whereas on projects the requirements are defined and locked down from the very beginning making it difficult to change them later iterative product development allows the software to evolve in response to changes in business environment or market requirements because of the short iteration style of agile software development it also has strong connections with the lean startup concept code vs documentation in a letter to ieee computer steven rakitin expressed cynicism about agile software development calling it yet another attempt to undermine the discipline of software engineering and translating working software over comprehensive documentation as we want to spend all our time coding remember real programmers dont write documentation this is disputed by proponents of agile software development who state that developers should write documentation if that is the best way to achieve the relevant goals but that there are often better ways to achieve those goals than writing static documentation scott ambler states that documentation should be just barely good enough jbge while too little documentation may also cause problems for maintenance communication learning and knowledge sharing alistair cockburn wrote of the crystal clear method crystal considers development a series of cooperative games and intends that the documentation is enough to help the next win at the next game the work products for crystal include use cases risk list iteration plan core domain models and design notes to inform on choiceshowever there are no templates for these documents and descriptions are necessarily vague but the objective is clear just enough documentation for the next game i always tend to characterize this to my team as what would you want to know if you joined the team tomorrowalistair cockburn agile software development methods software development

development teams to adapt working practices according to the needs of individual products largescale offshore and distributed agile software development has been widely seen as highly suited to certain types of environments including small teams of experts working on greenfield projects in response a range of strategies and patterns has evolved for overcoming challenges with largescale development efforts 20 developers amongst other challenges and there are now several recognised frameworks that seek to mitigate or avoid these challenges scaled agile framework safe dean leffingwell

brown enterprise scrum mike beedle setchu scrumbased lightweight framework michael ebbage xscale agile path holistic software development there are many conflicting viewpoints on whether all of these are effective or indeed fit the definition of agile development and this remains an active and ongoing area of research when agile software development is applied in a distributed setting with teams dispersed across multiple business locations it is commonly referred to as distributed agile development the goal is to leverage the unique benefits offered by each approach distributed development allow organizations to build software by strategically setting up teams in different parts of the globe virtually building software roundtheclock more commonly referred to as followthesun model on the other hand agile development provides increased transparency continuous feedback and more flexibility when responding to changes regulated domains agile software development methods were initially seen as best suitable for noncritical product developments thereby excluded from use in regulated domains such as medical devices pharmaceutical financial nuclear systems automotive and avionics sectors etc however in the last several years there have been several initiatives for the adaptation of agile methods for these domains there are numerous standards that may apply in regulated domains including iso 26262 iso 9000 iso 9001 and isoiec 15504 a number of key concerns are of particular importance in regulated domains quality assurance qa systematic and inherent quality management underpinning a controlled professional process and reliability and correctness of product safety and security formal planning and risk management to mitigate safety risks for users and securely protecting users from unintentional and malicious misuse traceability documentation providing auditable evidence of regulatory compliance and facilitating traceability and investigation of problems verification and validation vv embedded throughout the software development process eg user requirements specification functional specification design specification code review unit tests integration tests system tests experience and adoption although agile software development methods can be used with any programming paradigm or language in practice they were originally closely associated with objectoriented environments such as smalltalk and lisp and later java the initial adopters of agile methods were usually small to mediumsized teams working on unprecedented systems with requirements that were difficult to finalize and likely to change as the system was being developed this section describes common problems that organizations encounter when they try to adopt agile software development methods as well as various techniques to measure the quality and performance of agile teams measuring agility the best agile practitioners have always emphasized sound engineering principles as a result there are a number of best practices and tools for measuring the performance of agile software development and teams internal assessments the agility measurement index amongst others rates developments against five dimensions of product development duration risk novelty effort and interaction public surveys one of the early studies reporting gains in quality productivity and business satisfaction by using agile software developments methods was a survey conducted by shine technologies from november 2002 to january 2003 a similar survey the state of agile is conducted every year starting in 2006 with thousands of participants from around the software development community this tracks trends on the benefits of agility lessons learned and good practices each survey has reported increasing numbers saying that agile software development helps them deliver software faster improves their ability to manage changing customer priorities and increases their productivity common agile software development pitfalls organizations and teams implementing agile software development often face difficulties transitioning from more traditional methods such as waterfall development such as teams having an agile process forced on them these are often termed agile antipatterns or more commonly agile smells below are some common examples lack of overall product design a goal of agile software development is to focus more on producing working software and less on documentation this is in contrast to waterfall models where the process is often highly controlled and minor changes to the system require significant revision of supporting documentation however this does not justify completely doing without any analysis or design at all failure to pay attention to design can cause a team to proceed rapidly at first but then to have significant rework required as they attempt to scale up the system one of the key features of agile software development is that it is iterative when done correctly design emerges as the system is developed and commonalities and opportunities for reuse are discovered adding stories to an iteration in progress in agile software development stories similar to use case descriptions are typically used to define requirements and an iteration is a short period of time during which the team commits to specific goals this does not mean that a story cannot expand teams must deal with new information which may produce additional tasks for a story if the new information prevents the story from being completed during the iteration then it should be carried over to a subsequent iteration however it should be prioritized against all remaining stories as the new information may have changed the storys original priority lack of sponsor support agile software development is often implemented as a grassroots effort in organizations by software development teams trying to optimize their development processes and ensure consistency in the software development life cycle by not having sponsor support teams may face difficulties and resistance from business partners other development teams and management additionally they may suffer without appropriate funding and resources insufficient training a survey performed by versionone found respondents cited insufficient training as the most significant cause for failed agile implementations product owner role is not properly filled the product owner is responsible for representing the business in the development activity and is often the most demanding role a common mistake is to have the product owner role filled by someone from the development team this requires the team to make its own decisions on prioritization without real feedback from the business they try to solve business issues internally or delay work as they reach outside the team for direction this often leads to distraction and a breakdown in collaboration teams are not focused agile software development requires teams to meet product commitments which means they should focus only on work for that product however team members who appear to have spare capacity are often expected to take on other work which makes it difficult for them to help complete the work to which their team had committed excessive preparationplanning teams may fall into the trap of spending too much time preparing or planning this is a common trap for teams less familiar with agile software development where the teams feel obliged to have a complete understanding and specification of all stories teams should be prepared to move forward only with those stories in which they have confidence then during the iteration continue to discover and prepare work for subsequent iterations often referred to as backlog refinement or grooming problemsolving in the daily standup a daily standup should be a focused timely meeting where all team members disseminate information if problemsolving occurs it often can only involve certain team members and potentially is not the best use of the entire teams time if during the daily standup the team starts diving into problemsolving it should be set aside until a subteam can discuss usually immediately after the standup completes assigning tasks one of the intended benefits of agile software development is to empower the team to make choices as they are closest to the problem additionally they should make choices as close to implementation as possible to use more timely information in the decision if team members are assigned tasks by others or too early in the process the benefits of localized and timely decision making can be lost being assigned work also constrains team members into certain roles for example team member a must always do the database work which limits opportunities for crosstraining team members themselves can choose to take on tasks that stretch their abilities and provide crosstraining opportunities scrum master as a contributor another common pitfall is for a scrum master to act as a contributor while not prohibited by the scrum methodology the scrum master needs to ensure they have the capacity to act in the role of scrum master first and not working on development tasks a scrum masters role is to facilitate the process rather than create the product having the scrum master also multitasking may result in too many context switches to be productive additionally as a scrum master is responsible for ensuring roadblocks are removed so that the team can make forward progress the benefit gained by individual tasks moving forward may not outweigh roadblocks that are deferred due to lack of capacity lack of test automation due to the iterative nature of agile development multiple rounds of testing are often needed automated testing helps reduce the impact of repeated unit integration and regression tests and frees developers and testers to focus on higher value work test automation also supports continued refactoring required by iterative software development allowing a developer to quickly run tests to confirm refactoring has not modified the functionality of the application may reduce the workload and increase confidence that cleanup efforts have not introduced new defects allowing technical debt to build up focusing on delivering new functionality may result in increased technical debt the team must allow themselves time for defect remediation and refactoring technical debt hinders planning abilities by increasing the amount of unscheduled work as production defects distract the team from further progress as the system evolves it is important to refactor as entropy of the system naturally increases attempting to take on too much in an iteration a common misconception is that agile software development allows continuous change however an iteration backlog is an agreement of what work can be completed during an iteration fixed time resources scope and quality agile software development fixes time iteration duration quality and ideally resources in advance though maintaining fixed resources may be difficult if developers are often pulled away from tasks to handle production incidents while the scope remains variable the customer or product owner often push for a fixed scope for an iteration however teams should be reluctant to commit to the locked time resources and scope commonly known as the project management triangle efforts to add scope to the fixed time and resources of agile software development may result in decreased quality developer burnout due to the focused pace and continuous nature of agile practices there is a heightened risk of burnout among members of the delivery team agile management the term agile management is applied to an iterative incremental method of managing the design and build activities of engineering information technology and other business areas that aim to provide new product or service development in a highly flexible and interactive manner based on the principles expressed in the manifesto for agile software development agile x techniques may also be called extreme project management it is a variant of iterative life cycle while iterative methods evolve the entire set of deliverables over time completing them near the end of the project both iterative and agile methods were developed as a reaction to various obstacles that developed in more sequential forms of project organization for example as technology projects grow in complexity end users tend to have difficulty defining the longterm requirements without being able to view progressive prototypes projects that develop in iterations can constantly gather feedback to help refine those requirements agile management also offers a simple framework promoting communication and reflection on past work amongst team members agile methods are mentioned in the guide to the project management body of knowledge pmbok guide under the project lifecycle definition adaptive project life cycle a project life cycle also known as changedriven or agile methods that is intended to facilitate change and require a high degree of ongoing stakeholder involvement adaptive life cycles are also iterative and incremental but differ in that iterations are very rapid usually 24 weeks in length and are fixed in time and resources applications outside software development agile brazil 2014 conference according to jeanloup richet research fellow at essec institute for strategic innovation services this approach can be leveraged effectively for nonsoftware products and for project management in general especially in areas of innovation and uncertainty the end result is a product or project that best meets current customer needs and is delivered with minimal costs waste and time enabling companies to achieve bottom line gains earlier than via traditional approaches agile software development methods have been extensively used for development of software products and some of them use certain characteristics of software such as object technologies eg strategy governance risk finance under the terms business agility or agile business management under an agile business management model agile software development techniques practices principles and values are expressed across five domains integrated customer engagement to embed customers within any delivery process to share accountability for productservice delivery facilitationbased management adopting agile management models like the role of scrum master to facilitate the daytoday operation of teams agile work practices adopting specific iterative and incremental work practices such as scrum kanban testdriven development or featuredriven development across all business functions from sales human resources finance and marketing an enabling organisational structure with a focus on staff engagement personal autonomy and outcomes based governance applications of agile process along with devops and lean manufacturing to data analytics business intelligence big data and data science is called dataops agile software development paradigms can be used in other areas of life such as raising children its success in child development might be founded on some basic management principles communication adaptation and awareness in a ted talk bruce feiler shared how he applied basic agile paradigms to household management and raising children criticism agile practices can be inefficient in large organizations and certain types of developments some methods such as dynamic systems development method dsdm attempt this in a disciplined way without sacrificing fundamental principles the increasing adoption of agile practices has also been criticized as being a management fad that simply describes existing good practices under new jargon promotes a one size fits all mindset towards development strategies and wrongly emphasizes method over results alistair cockburn organized a celebration of the 10th anniversary of the manifesto for agile software development in snowbird utah on 12 february 2011 gathering some 30 people who had been involved at the original meeting and since a list of about 20 elephants in the room undiscussable agile topicsissues were collected including aspects the alliances failures and limitations of agile software development practices and context possible causes commercial interests decontextualization no obvious way to make progress based on failure limited objective evidence cognitive biases and reasoning fallacies politics and culture as philippe kruchten wrote the agile movement is in some ways a bit like a teenager very selfconscious checking constantly its appearance in a mirror accepting few criticisms only interested in being with its peers rejecting en bloc all wisdom from the past just because it is from the past adopting fads and new jargon at times cocky and arrogant but i have no doubts that it will mature further become more open to the outside world more reflective and therefore more effectivephilippe kruchten workers selfmanagement abrahamsson p salo o

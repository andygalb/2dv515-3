related articles list of datasets for machinelearning research outline of machine learning machine learning portalvte data mining is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning statistics and database systems the term data mining is in fact a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data not the extraction mining of data itself often the more general terms large scale data analysis and analytics or when referring to actual methods artificial intelligence and machine learning are more appropriate the actual data mining task is the semiautomatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown interesting patterns such as groups of data records cluster analysis unusual records anomaly detection and dependencies association rule mining sequential pattern mining this usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices these patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data and may be used in further analysis or for example in machine learning and predictive analytics for example the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system neither the data collection data preparation nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step but do belong to the overall kdd process as additional steps the related terms data dredging data fishing and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are or may be too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered these methods can however be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations etymology in the 1960s statisticians and economists used terms like data fishing or data dredging to refer to what they considered the bad practice of analyzing data without an apriori hypothesis the term data mining was used in a similarly critical way by economist michael lovell in an article published in the review of economic studies 1983 lovell indicates that the practice masquerades under a variety of aliases ranging from experimentation positive to fishing or snooping negative the term data mining appeared around 1990 in the database community generally with positive connotations for a short time in 1980s a phrase database mining was used but since it was trademarked by hnc a san diegobased company to pitch their database mining workstation currently the terms data mining and knowledge discovery are used interchangeably in the academic community the major forums for research started in 1995 when the first international conference on data mining and knowledge discovery kdd95 was started in montreal under aaai sponsorship it was cochaired by usama fayyad and ramasamy uthurusamy a year later in 1996 usama fayyad launched the journal by kluwer called data mining and knowledge discovery as its founding editorinchief later he started the sigkdd newsletter sigkdd explorations the kdd international conference became the primary highest quality conference in data mining with an acceptance rate of research paper submissions below 18 the journal data mining and knowledge discovery is the primary research journal of the field background the manual extraction of patterns from data has occurred for centuries early methods of identifying patterns in data include bayes theorem 1700s and regression analysis 1800s the proliferation ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology has dramatically increased data collection storage and manipulation ability as data sets have grown in size and complexity direct handson data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect automated data processing aided by other discoveries in computer science such as neural networks cluster analysis genetic algorithms 1950s decision trees and decision rules 1960s and support vector machines 1990s data mining is the process of applying these methods with the intention of uncovering hidden patterns in large data sets it bridges the gap from applied statistics and artificial intelligence which usually provide the mathematical background to database management by exploiting the way data is stored and indexed in databases to execute the actual learning and discovery algorithms more efficiently allowing such methods to be applied to ever larger data sets process the knowledge discovery in databases kdd process is commonly defined with the stages selection preprocessing transformation data mining interpretationevaluation it exists however in many variations on this theme such as the cross industry standard process for data mining crispdm which defines six phases business understanding data understanding data preparation modeling evaluation deployment or a simplified process such as 1 preprocessing 2 data mining and 3 results validation polls conducted in 2002 2004 2007 and 2014 show that the crispdm methodology is the leading methodology used by data miners preprocessing before data mining algorithms can be used a target data set must be assembled as data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data the target data set must be large enough to contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit a common source for data is a data mart or data warehouse preprocessing is essential to analyze the multivariate data sets before data mining the target set is then cleaned data cleaning removes the observations containing noise and those with missing data data mining data mining involves six common classes of tasks anomaly detection outlierchangedeviation detection the identification of unusual data records that might be interesting or data errors that require further investigation association rule learning dependency modelling searches for relationships between variables for example a supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits using association rule learning the supermarket can determine which products are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing purposes this is sometimes referred to as market basket analysis clustering is the task of discovering groups and structures in the data that are in some way or another similar without using known structures in the data classification is the task of generalizing known structure to apply to new data for example an email program might attempt to classify an email as legitimate or as spam regression attempts to find a function which models the data with the least error that is for estimating the relationships among data or datasets summarization providing a more compact representation of the data set including visualization and report generation results validation an example of data produced by data dredging through a bot operated by statistician tyler vigen apparently showing a close link between the best word winning a spelling bee competition and the number of people in the united states killed by venomous spiders the similarity in trends is obviously a coincidence data mining can unintentionally be misused and can then produce results which appear to be significant but which do not actually predict future behaviour and cannot be reproduced on a new sample of data and bear little use often this results from investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper statistical hypothesis testing a simple version of this problem in machine learning is known as overfitting but the same problem can arise at different phases of the process and thus a traintest split when applicable at all may not be sufficient to prevent this from happening the final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify that the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set not all patterns found by the data mining algorithms are necessarily valid it is common for the data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set this is called overfitting to overcome this the evaluation uses a test set of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained the learned patterns are applied to this test set and the resulting output is compared to the desired output for example a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish spam from legitimate emails would be trained on a training set of sample emails once trained the learned patterns would be applied to the test set of emails on which it had not been trained the accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many emails they correctly classify a number of statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm such as roc curves if the learned patterns do not meet the desired standards subsequently it is necessary to reevaluate and change the preprocessing and data mining steps if the learned patterns do meet the desired standards then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns and turn them into knowledge research the premier professional body in the field is the association for computing machinerys acm special interest group sig on knowledge discovery and data mining sigkdd computer science conferences on data mining include cikm conference acm conference on information and knowledge management european conference on machine learning and principles and practice of knowledge discovery in databases kdd conference acm sigkdd conference on knowledge discovery and data mining data mining topics are also present on many data managementdatabase conferences such as the icde conference sigmod conference and international conference on very large data bases standards there have been some efforts to define standards for the data mining process for example the 1999 european cross industry standard process for data mining crispdm 10 and the 2004 java data mining standard jdm 10 development on successors to these processes crispdm 20 and jdm 20 was active in 2006 but has stalled since jdm 20 was withdrawn without reaching a final draft for exchanging the extracted models in particular for use in predictive analytics the key standard is the predictive model markup language pmml which is an xmlbased language developed by the data mining group dmg and supported as exchange format by many data mining applications as the name suggests it only covers prediction models a particular data mining task of high importance to business applications however extensions to cover for example subspace clustering have been proposed independently of the dmg notable uses examples of data mining see also categoryapplied data mining data mining is used wherever there is digital data available today notable examples of data mining can be found throughout business medicine science and surveillance privacy concerns and ethics while the term data mining itself may have no ethical implications it is often associated with the mining of information in relation to peoples behavior ethical and otherwise the ways in which data mining can be used can in some cases and contexts raise questions regarding privacy legality and ethics data mining requires data preparation which can uncover information or patterns which may compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations a common way for this to occur is through data aggregation data aggregation involves combining data together possibly from various sources in a way that facilitates analysis but that also might make identification of private individuallevel data deducible or otherwise apparent it is recommended that an individual is made aware of the following before data are collected the purpose of the data collection and any known data mining projects how the data will be used who will be able to mine the data and use the data and their derivatives the status of security surrounding access to the data how collected data can be updated data may also be modified so as to become anonymous so that individuals may not readily be identified the inadvertent revelation of personally identifiable information leading to the provider violates fair information practices this indiscretion can cause financial emotional or bodily harm to the indicated individual in one instance of privacy violation the patrons of walgreens filed a lawsuit against the company in 2011 for selling prescription information to data mining companies who in turn provided the data to pharmaceutical companies situation in europe europe has rather strong privacy laws and efforts are underway to further strengthen the rights of the consumers however the useu safe harbor principles currently effectively expose european users to privacy exploitation by us companies as a consequence of edward snowdens global surveillance disclosure there has been increased discussion to revoke this agreement as in particular the data will be fully exposed to the national security agency and attempts to reach an agreement have failed situation in the united states in the united states privacy concerns have been addressed by the us congress via the passage of regulatory controls such as the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa the hipaa requires individuals to give their informed consent regarding information they provide and its intended present and future uses according to an article in biotech business week this underscores the necessity for data anonymity in data aggregation and mining practices us information privacy legislation such as hipaa and the family educational rights and privacy act ferpa applies only to the specific areas that each such law addresses use of data mining by the majority of businesses in the us is not controlled by any legislation copyright law situation in europe due to a lack of flexibilities in european copyright and database law the mining of incopyright works such as web mining without the permission of the copyright owner is not legal where a database is pure data in europe there is likely to be no copyright but database rights may exist so data mining becomes subject to regulations by the database directive on the recommendation of the hargreaves review this led to the uk government to amend its copyright law in 2014 situation in the united states by contrast to europe the flexible nature of us copyright law and in particular fair use means that content mining in america as well as other fair use countries such as israel taiwan and south korea is viewed as being legal as content mining is transformative that is it does not supplant the original work it is viewed as being lawful under fair use for example as part of the google book settlement the presiding judge on the case ruled that googles digitisation project of incopyright books was lawful in part because of the transformative uses that the digitisation project displayed one being text and data mining software see also categorydata

mathematical software see also gdels incompleteness theorems and time complexity mathematical software is software used to model analyze or calculate numeric symbolic or geometric data it is a type of application software which is used for solving mathematical problems or mathematical study there are various views to what is the mathematics so there is various views of the category of mathematical software which used for them over from narrow to wide sense a type of mathematical software math library also used by built in the part of another scientific software a most primary them for example to calculate elementary function by floating point arithmetic may be in the category of mathematical software they are often usually built in the general purpose systems as middleware so to speak mathematical software is not only an application software but also basis of another scientific software and that is its one of the characteristic of mathematical software as that mean several mathematical software often have good user interface for educational purpose see educational math software but the core parts of solver of them direct dependent to the algorism by the mathematical knowledge so it may be common sense that it does not process if it not well solved on mathematical construction at least there is physical limitation of hardware that is typical difference of mathematical software for another application software specially it may be sure common sense that to the attention that there is a such as next case in mathematical software using that is not always solvable that may be solved theoritically but most hard to solve actually or physically by computer caused by not in the polynomial timeencryption software apply the second case evolution of mathematical software numerical analysis and symbolic computation had been in most important place of the subject but other kind of them is also growing now a useful mathematical knowledge of such as algorism which exist before the invention of electronic computer helped to mathematical software developing on the other hand by the growth of computing power such as seeing on moores law the new treatment for example a new kind of technique such as data assimilation which combined numerical analysis and statistics needing conversely the progress of the mathematical science or applied mathematics the progress of mathematical information presentation such as tex or mathml so called one purpose software which used special subject will alive with adapting for environment progress at normalization of platform so the diversity of mathematical software will be kept software calculator software calculator a software calculator allows the user to perform simple mathematical operations like addition multiplication exponentiation and trigonometry data input is typically manual and the output is a text label computer algebra systems list of computer algebra systems many mathematical suites are computer algebra systems that use symbolic mathematics they are designed to solve classical algebra equations and problems in human readable notation statistics list of statistical packages

optimization software list of optimization software geometry list of interactive geometry software and list of information graphics software numerical analysis list of numerical analysis software tk solver is a mathematical modeling and problem solving software system based on a declarative rulebased language commercialized by universal technical systems inc the netlib repository contains various collections of software routines for numerical problems mostly in fortran and c commercial products implementing many different numerical algorithms include the imsl nmath and nag libraries a free alternative is the gnu scientific library a different approach is taken by the numerical recipes library where emphasis is placed on clear understanding of algorithms many computer algebra systems listed above can also be used for numerical computations see also comparison of numerical analysis software music mathematics software list of music software see also music and mathematics music

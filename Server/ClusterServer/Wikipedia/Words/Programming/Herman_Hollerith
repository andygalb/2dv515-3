herman hollerith herman hollerith february 29 1860 november 17 1929 was an american inventor who developed an electromechanical punched card tabulator to assist in summarizing information and later accounting he was the founder of the tabulating machine company that was amalgamated via stock acquisition in 1911 with three other companies to form a fifth company the computingtabulatingrecording company later renamed ibm hollerith is regarded as one of the seminal figures in the development of data processing personal life herman hollerith was born the son of german immigrant prof georg hollerith from grofischlingen near neustadt an der weinstrae in buffalo new york where he spent his early childhood electromechanical tabulation of data unit record equipment at the urging of john

the purpose set forth inventions and businesses hollerith punched card holleriths grave at oak hill cemetery in georgetown in washington dc hollerith had left teaching and begun working for the united states census bureau in the year he filed his first patent application titled art of compiling statistics it was filed on september 23 1884 us patent 395782 was granted on january 8 1889 hollerith initially did business under his own name as the hollerith electric tabulating system specializing in punched card data processing equipment in 1896 hollerith founded the tabulating machine company in 1905 renamed the tabulating machine company he invented the first automatic cardfeed mechanism and the first keypunch the 1890 tabulator was hardwired to operate on 1890 census cards a control panel in his 1906 type i tabulator simplified rewiring for different jobs the 1920s removable control panel supported prewiring and near instant job changing these inventions were among the foundations of the data processing industry and holleriths punched cards later used for computer inputoutput continued in use for almost a century in 1911 four corporations including holleriths firm were amalgamated to form a fifth company the computingtabulatingrecording company ctr death and legacy hollerith is buried at oak hill cemetery in the georgetown neighborhood of washington dc hollerith cards were named after herman hollerith they eventually reached 128 columns width his greatgrandson the rt rev herman hollerith iv is the episcopal bishop of the diocese of southern virginia and another

systems modeling language sysml diagrams collage the systems modeling language sysml is a generalpurpose modeling language for systems engineering applications it supports the specification analysis design verification and validation of a broad range of systems and systemsofsystems sysml was originally developed by an open source specification project and includes an open source license for distribution and use sysml is defined as an extension of a subset of the unified modeling language uml using umls profile mechanism the languages extensions were designed to support systems engineering activities overview sysml offers systems engineers several noteworthy improvements over uml which tends to be softwarecentric these improvements include the following sysmls semantics are more flexible and expressive sysml reduces umls softwarecentric restrictions and adds two new diagram types requirement and parametric diagrams the former can be used for requirements engineering the latter can be used for performance analysis and quantitative analysis consequent to these enhancements sysml is able to model a wide range of systems which may include hardware software information processes personnel and facilities sysml is a comparatively little language that is easier to learn and apply since sysml removes many of umls softwarecentric constructs the overall language measures smaller both in diagram types and total constructs sysml allocation tables support common kinds of allocations whereas uml provides only limited support for tabular notations sysml furnishes flexible allocation tables that support requirements allocation functional allocation and structural allocation this capability facilitates automated verification and validation vv and gap analysis sysml model management constructs support models views and viewpoints these constructs extend umls capabilities and are architecturally aligned with ieeestd14712000 ieee recommended practice for architectural description of software intensive systems sysml reuses seven of uml 2s fourteen diagrams and adds two diagrams requirement and parametric diagrams for a total of nine diagram types sysml also supports allocation tables a tabular format that can be dynamically derived from sysml allocation relationships a table which compares sysml and uml 2 diagrams is available in the sysml faq the advantages of sysml over uml for systems engineering become obvious when considering a concrete example like modeling an automotive system with sysml one can use requirement diagrams to efficiently capture functional performance and interface requirements whereas with uml one is subject to the limitations of use case diagrams to define highlevel functional requirements likewise with sysml one can use parametric diagrams to precisely define performance and quantitative constraints like maximum acceleration minimum curb weight and total air conditioning capacity uml provides no straightforward mechanism to capture this sort of essential performance and quantitative information concerning the rest of the automotive system enhanced activity diagrams and state machine diagrams can be used to specify the embedded software control logic and information flows for the onboard automotive computers other sysml structural and behavioral diagrams can be used to model factories that build the automobiles as well as the interfaces between the organizations that work in the factories history the sysml initiative originated in a january 2001 decision by the international council on systems engineering incose model driven systems design workgroup to customize the uml for systems engineering applications following this decision incose and the object management group omg which maintains the uml specification jointly chartered the omg systems engineering domain special interest group se dsig in july 2001 the se dsig with support from incose and the iso ap 233 workgroup developed the requirements for the modeling language which were subsequently issued by the omg parting in the uml for systems engineering request for proposal uml for se rfp omg document ad030341 in march 2003 in 2003 cris kobryn and sanford friedenthal organized and cochaired the sysml partners an informal association of industry leaders and tool vendors the original technical contributors and coauthors of the sysml 10a specification were laurent balmelli conrad bock rick steiner alan moore and roger burkhart the sysml partners distributed their first open source sysml specification drafts in 2004 and submitted sysml 10a to the omg for technology adoption in november 2005 omg sysml after a series of competing sysml specification proposals a sysml merge team was proposed to the omg in april 2006 this proposal was voted upon and adopted by the omg in july 2006 as omg sysml to differentiate it from the original open source specification from which it was derived because omg sysml is derived from open source sysml it also includes an open source license for distribution and use the omg sysml v 10 specification was issued by the omg as an available specification in september 2007 the omg has been working on the next generation of sysml and issued a request for proposals rfp for version 2 on december 8 2017 following its open standardization process diagrams sysml includes 9 types of diagram some of which are taken from uml block definition diagram internal block diagram package diagram use case diagram requirement diagram activity diagram sequence diagram state machine diagram parametric diagram tools there are several modeling tool vendors already offering sysml support or are in the process of updating their tools to comply with the omg sysml specification lists of tool vendors who support or have announced support of sysml or omg sysml can be found on the sysml forum websites respectively model exchange as an omg uml 20 profile sysml models are designed to be exchanged using the xml metadata interchange xmi standard in addition architectural alignment work is underway to support the iso 10303 also known as step the standard for the exchange of product

acm computing classification system the acm computing classification system ccs is a subject classification system for computing devised by the association for computing machinery acm the system is comparable to the mathematics subject classification msc in scope aims and structure being used by the various acm journals to organise subjects by area history the system has gone through seven revisions the first version being published in 1964 and revised versions appearing in 1982 1983 1987 1991 1998 and the now current version in 2012 structure the acm computing classification system version 2012 has a revolutionary change in some areas for example in software that now is called software and its engineering which has three main subjects software organization and properties this subject addresses properties of the software itself software notations and tools this subject covers programming languages and other tools for writing programs software creation and management this subject covers human activities including software management it is hierarchically structured in four levels thus for example one branch of the hierarchy contains computing methodologies artificial intelligence knowledge representation and reasoning ontology engineering vteacm computing classification systemthe 2012 version of the acm classification has the following main categoriesgeneral and referencedocument types crosscomputing tools and techniqueshardwareprinted circuit boards communication hardware interfaces and storage integrated circuits very large scale integration design power

pp5765 acm computing classification system is the homepage of the system including links to four complete versions of the system for 1964 the acm computing research repository uses a classification scheme that is much coarser than the acm subject classification and does not cover all areas of cs but is intended to better cover active areas of research in addition papers in this repository are classified according to the acm subject classification this computer science article is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding itvte

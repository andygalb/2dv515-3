document management system digital archiving redirects here for the longterm archiving of digital media see digital preservation a document management system dms is a system based on computer programs in the case of the management of digital documents used to track manage and store documents and reduce paper most are capable of keeping a record of the various versions created and modified by different users history tracking the term has some overlap with the concepts of content management systems it is often viewed as a component of enterprise content management ecm systems and related to digital asset management document imaging workflow systems and records management systems history beginning in the 1980s a number of vendors began to develop software systems to manage paperbased documents these systems dealt with paper documents which included not only printed and published documents but also photographs prints etc later developers began to write a second type of system which could manage electronic documents ie all those documents or files created on computers and often stored on users local filesystems the earliest electronic document management edm systems managed either proprietary file types or a limited number of file formats many of these systems later became known as document imaging systems because they focused on the capture storage indexing and retrieval of image file formats edm systems evolved to a point where systems could manage any type of file format that could be stored on the network the applications grew to encompass electronic documents collaboration tools security workflow and auditing capabilities these systems enabled an organization to capture faxes and forms to save copies of the documents as images and to store the image files in the repository for security and quick retrieval retrieval made possible because the system handled the extraction of the text from the document in the process of capture and the textindexer function provided textretrieval capabilities while many edm systems store documents in their native file format microsoft word or excel pdf some webbased document management systems are beginning to store content in the form of html these policy management systems components document management systems commonly provide storage versioning metadata security as well as indexing and retrieval capabilities here is a description of these components topic description metadata metadata is typically stored for each document metadata may for example include the date the document will be stored and the identity of the user storing it the dms may also extract metadata from the document automatically or prompt the user to add metadata some systems also use optical character recognition on scanned images or perform text extraction on electronic documents the resulting extracted text can be used to assist users in locating documents by identifying probable keywords or providing for full text search capability or can be used on its own extracted text can also be stored as a component of metadata stored with the document or separately from the document as a source for searching document collections integration many document management systems attempt to provide document management functionality directly to other applications so that users may retrieve existing documents directly from the document management system repository make changes and save the changed document back to the repository as a new version all without leaving the application such integration is commonly available for a variety of software tools such as workflow management and content management systems typically through an application programming interface api using open standards such as odma ldap webdav and soap or restful web services capture capture primarily involves accepting and processing images of paper documents from scanners or multifunction printers optical character recognition ocr software is often used whether integrated into the hardware or as standalone software in order to convert digital images into machine readable text optical mark recognition omr software is sometimes used to extract values of checkboxes or bubbles capture may also involve accepting electronic documents and other computerbased files data validation data validation rules can check for document failures missing signatures misspelled names and other issues recommending realtime correction options before importing data into the dms additional processing in the form of harmonization and data format changes may also be applied as part of data validation indexing indexing tracks electronic documents indexing may be as simple as keeping track of unique document identifiers but often it takes a more complex form providing classification through the documents metadata or even through word indexes extracted from the documents contents indexing exists mainly to support information query and retrieval one area of critical importance for rapid retrieval is the creation of an index topology or scheme storage store electronic documents storage of the documents often includes management of those same documents where they are stored for how long migration of the documents from one storage media to another hierarchical storage management and eventual document destruction retrieval retrieve the electronic documents from the storage although the notion of retrieving a particular document is simple retrieval in the electronic context can be quite complex and powerful simple retrieval of individual documents can be supported by allowing the user to specify the unique document identifier and having the system use the basic index or a nonindexed query on its data store to retrieve the document or may perform more timeconsuming searches through the documents contents to return a list of the potentially relevant documents see also document retrieval distribution a document ready for distribution has to be in a format that cannot be easily altered an original master copy of the document is usually never used for distribution rather an electronic link to the document itself is more common if a document is to be distributed electronically in a regulatory environment then additional criteria must be met including assurances of traceability and versioning even across other systems this approach applies to both of the systems by which the document is to be interexchanged if the integrity of the document is imperative security document security is vital in many document management applications compliance requirements for certain documents can be quite complex depending on the type of documents for instance in the united states standards such as iso 9001 and iso 13485 as well as us food and drug administration regulations dictate how the document control process should be addressed document management systems may have a rights management module that allows an administrator to give access to documents based on type to only certain people or groups of people document marking at the time of printing or pdfcreation is an essential element to preclude alteration or unintended use workflow workflow is a complex process and some document management systems have either a builtin workflow module there are different types of workflow usage depends on the environment to which the electronic document management system edms is applied manual workflow requires a user to view the document and decide whom to send it to rulesbased workflow allows an administrator to create a rule that dictates the flow of the document through an organization for instance an invoice passes through an approval process and then is routed to the accountspayable department dynamic rules allow for branches to be created in a workflow process a simple example would be to enter an invoice amount and if the amount is lower than a certain set amount it follows different routes through the organization advanced workflow mechanisms can manipulate content or signal external processes while these rules are in effect collaboration collaboration should be inherent in an edms in its basic form collaborative edms should allow documents to be retrieved and worked on by an authorized user access should be blocked to other users while work is being performed on the document other advanced forms of collaboration act in real time allowing multiple users to view and modify or markup documents at the same time the resulting document is comprehensive including all users additions collaboration within document management systems means that the various markups by each individual user during the collaboration session are recorded allowing document history to be monitored versioning versioning is a process by which documents are checked in or out of the document management system allowing users to retrieve previous versions and to continue work from a selected point versioning is useful for documents that change over time and require updating but it may be necessary to go back to or reference a previous copy searching searching finds documents and folders using template attributes or full text search documents can be searched using various attributes and document content federated search this refers to the capability to extend search capabilities to draw results from multiple sources or from multiple dmses within an enterprise publishing publishing a document involves the procedures of proofreading peer or public reviewing authorizing printing and approving etc those steps ensure prudence and logical thinking any careless handling may result in the inaccuracy of the document and therefore mislead or upset its users and readers in law regulated industries some of the procedures have to be completed as evidenced by their corresponding signatures and the dates on which the document was signed refer to the iso divisions of ics 0114040 and 3524030 for further information the published document should be in a format that is not easily altered without a specific knowledge or tools and yet it is readonly or portable hard copy reproduction documentimage reproduction is often necessary within a document management system and its supported output devices and reproduction capabilities should be considered standardization many industry associations publish their own lists of particular document control standards that are used in their particular field following is a list of some of the relevant iso documents divisions ics 0114010 and 0114020 iso 2709 information and documentation format for information exchange iso 15836 information and documentation the dublin core metadata

document management portable document format document control government regulations require that companies working in certain industries control their documents these industries include accounting for example 8th eu directive sarbanesoxley act food safety eg food safety modernization act iso mentioned above medicaldevice manufacturing fda manufacture of blood human cells and tissue products fda healthcare jcaho and information technology itil some industries work under stricter document control requirements due to the type of information they retain for privacy warranty or other highly regulated purposes examples include protected health information phi as required by hipaa or construction project documents required for warranty periods an information systems strategy plan issp can shape organisational information systems over medium to longterm periods documents stored in a document management systemsuch as procedures work instructions and policy statementsprovide evidence of documents under control failing to comply can cause fines the loss of business or damage to a businesss reputation the following are important aspects of document control reviewing and approving documents prior to release reviews and approvals ensuring changes and revisions are clearly identified ensuring that relevant versions of applicable documents are available at their points of use ensuring that documents remain legible and identifiable ensuring that external documents such as customersupplied documents or supplier manuals are identified and controlled preventing unintended use of obsolete documents integrated dm integrated document management comprises the technologies tools and methods used to capture manage store preserve deliver and dispose of documents across an enterprise in this context documents are any of a myriad of information assets including images office documents graphics and drawings as well as the new electronic objects such as web pages email instant messages and video document management software paper documents have long been used in storing information however paper can be costly and if used excessively wasteful document management software is not simply a tool but it lets a user manage access track and edit information stored document management software is an electronic cabinet that can be used to organize all paper and digital files web based document management software are becoming the staple of the industry there are many document management software systems available today to manage information in well

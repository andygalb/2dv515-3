barry boehm not to be confused with the boehm garbage collector created by hansjuergen boehm barry boehm barry w boehm born 1935 is an american software engineer distinguished professor of computer science industrial and systems engineering the trw professor of software engineering and founding director of the center for systems and software engineering at the university of southern california he is known for his many contributions to the area of software engineering biography boehm received a ba in mathematics from harvard university in 1957 and a ms in 1961 and phd from ucla in 1964 both in mathematics as well he has also received honorary scd in computer science from the u of massachusetts in 2000 and in software engineering from the chinese academy of sciences in 2011 in 1955 he started working as a programmeranalyst at general dynamics in 1959 he switched to the rand corporation where he was head of the information sciences department until 1973 from 1973 to 1989 he was chief scientist of the defense systems group at trw inc from 1989 to 1992 he served within the us department of defense dod as director of the darpa information science and technology office and as director of the ddre software and computer technology office since 1992 he is trw professor of software engineering computer science department and director usc center for systems and software engineering formerly center for software engineering he has served on the board of several scientific journals including the ieee transactions on software engineering computer ieee software acm computing reviews automated software engineering software process and information and software technology recent awards for barry boehm include the office of the secretary of defense award for excellence in 1992 the asqc lifetime achievement award in 1994 the acm distinguished research award in software engineering in 1997 and the ieee international stevens award he is an aiaa fellow an acm fellow an ieee fellow and a member of the national academy of engineering he received the mellon award for excellence in mentoring in 2005 work boehms research interests include software development process modeling software requirements engineering software architectures software metrics and cost models software engineering environments and knowledgebased software engineering his contributions to the field according to boehm 1997 himself include the constructive cost model cocomo the spiral model of the software process the theory w winwin approach to software management and requirements determination and two advanced software engineering environments the trw software productivity system and quantum leap environment software versus hardware costs in an important 1973 report entitled ada the project the dod high order language working group to the defense advanced research projects agency darpa boehm predicted that software costs would overwhelm hardware costs darpa had expected him to predict that hardware would remain the biggest problem encouraging them to invest in even larger computers the report inspired a change of direction in computing software economics barry boehms 1981 book software engineering economics documents his constructive cost model cocomo it relates software development effort for a program in personmonths pm to thousand source lines of code ksloc p m

years brooks law applies adding programmers to a late project makes it later thus this formula is best applied to stable software development teams which have completed multiple projects spiral model spiral model boehm 1988 boehm also created the spiral model of software development in which the phases of development are repeatedly revisited this iterative software development process influenced mbase and extreme programming wideband delphi boehm refined the delphi method of estimation to include more group iteration making it more suitable for certain classes of problems such as software development this variant is called the wideband delphi method incremental commitment model the incremental commitment model icm it was only in 1998 after the development of the icm that barry boehm along with a winsor brown started to focus on reconciling it with the winwin spiral model and its incarnation in mbase in 2008 the evolving icm for software with its riskdriven anchor point decisions proved very useful to several projects which ended up having unusual life cycle phase sequences publications barry boehm has published over 170 articles and several books books a selection 1978

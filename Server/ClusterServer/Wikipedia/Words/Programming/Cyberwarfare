writers vte cyberwarfare is the use or targeting in a battlespace or warfare context of computers online control systems and networks definition a number of definitions of cyber warfare have been proposed with no single definition being widely adopted internationally richard a clarke defines it as actions by a nationstate to penetrate another nations computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption other definitions include nonstate actors such as terrorist groups companies political or ideological extremist groupsterrorist hacktivists and transnational criminal organizations some governments have made it an integral part of their overall military strategy with some having invested heavily in cyberwarfare capability this capability uses the same set of penetration testing methodologies but applies them in the case of united states doctrine in a strategic way to prevent cyber attacks against critical infrastructure reduce national vulnerability to cyber attacks minimize damage and recovery time from cyber attacks offensive operations are also part of these national level strategies for officially declared wars as well as undeclared secretive operations types of threat cyber warfare can present a multitude of threats towards a nation at the most basic level cyber attacks can be used to support traditional warfare for example tampering with the operation of air defences via cyber means in order to facilitate an air attack aside from these hard threats cyber warfare can also contribute towards soft threats such as espionage and propaganda espionage traditional espionage is not an act of war nor is cyberespionage and both are generally assumed to be ongoing between major powers despite this assumption some incidents can cause serious tensions between nations and are often described as attacks for example massive spying by the us on many countries revealed by edward snowden after the nsas spying on germanys chancellor angela merkel was revealed the chancellor compared the nsa with the stasi the nsa recording nearly every cell phone conversation in the bahamas without the bahamian governments permission the titan rain probes of american defense contractors computer systems since 2003 the office of personnel management data breach in the us widely attributed to china sabotage computers and satellites that coordinate other activities are vulnerable components of a system and could lead to the disruption of equipment compromise of military systems such as c4istar components that are responsible for orders and communications could lead to their interception or malicious replacement power water fuel communications and transportation infrastructure all may be vulnerable to disruption according to clarke the civilian realm is also at risk noting that the security breaches have already gone beyond stolen credit card numbers and that potential targets can also include the electric power grid trains or the stock market in midjuly 2010 security experts discovered a malicious software program called stuxnet that had infiltrated factory computers and had spread to plants around the world it is considered the first attack on critical industrial infrastructure that sits at the foundation of modern economies notes the new york times stuxnet while extremely effective in delaying irans nuclear program for the development of nuclear weaponry came at a high cost for the first time it became clear that not only could cyber weapons be defensive but they could be offensive the large decentralization and scale of cyberspace makes it extremely difficult to direct from a policy perspective nonstate actors can play as large a part in the cyberwar space as state actors which leads to dangerous sometimes disastrous consequences small groups of highly skilled malware developers are able to as effectively impact global politics and cyber warfare as large governmental agencies a major aspect of this ability lies in the willingness of these groups to share their exploits and developments on the web as a form of arms proliferation this allows lesser hackers to become more proficient in creating the large scale attacks that once only a small handful were skillful enough to manage in addition thriving black markets for these kinds of cyber weapons are buying and selling these cyber capabilities to the highest bidder without regard for consequences denialofservice attack denialofservice attack in computing a denialofservice attack dos attack or distributed denialofservice attack ddos attack is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users perpetrators of dos attacks typically target sites or services hosted on highprofile web servers such as banks credit card payment gateways and even root nameservers dos attacks may not be limited to computerbased methods as strategic physical attacks against infrastructure can be just as devastating for example cutting undersea communication cables may severely cripple some regions and countries with regards to their information warfare ability electrical power grid the federal government of the united states admits that the electric power grid is susceptible to cyberwarfare massive power outages caused by a cyber attack could disrupt the economy distract from a simultaneous military attack or create a national trauma howard schmidt former cybersecurity coordinator of the us commented on those possibilities its possible that hackers have gotten into administrative computer systems of utility companies but says those arent linked to the equipment controlling the grid at least not in developed countries has never heard that the grid itself has been hacked on 23 december 2015 what is believed to be a first known successful cyber attack on a power grid took place in ukraine leading to temporary blackouts and it was performed during an ongoing military confrontation propaganda cyber propaganda is an effort to control information in whatever form it takes and influence public opinion jowell and odonnell 2006 state that propaganda is the deliberate systematic attempt to shape perceptions manipulate cognitions and direct behavior to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist p7 the internet is a phenomenal means of communication people can get their message across to a huge audience and with this opens a window for evil terrorist organizations can use this medium to brainwash people it has been suggested that restricted media coverage of terrorist attacks would in turn decrease the number of terrorist attacks that occur afterwards cowen 2006 if this is the case an interesting perspective to look for in the data would be the ties that connect the media propaganda and the communicative messages that are being conveyed economic disruption in 2017 the wannacry and petya notpetya cyber attacks masquerading these threats have been recognized as the onset of the fifth generation cyber attacks motivations military in the us general keith b alexander first head of uscybercom told the senate armed services committee that computer network warfare is evolving so rapidly that there is a mismatch between our technical capabilities to conduct operations and the governing laws and policies cyber command is the newest global combatant and its sole mission is cyberspace outside the traditional battlefields of land sea air and space it will attempt to find and when necessary neutralize cyberattacks and to defend military computer networks alexander sketched out the broad battlefield envisioned for the computer warfare command listing the kind of targets that his new headquarters could be ordered to attack including traditional battlefield prizes commandandcontrol systems at military headquarters air defense networks and weapons systems that require computers to operate one cyber warfare scenario cyber shockwave which was wargamed on the cabinet level by former administration officials raised issues ranging from the national guard to the power grid to the limits of statutory authority the distributed nature of internet based attacks means that it is difficult to determine motivation and attacking party meaning that it is unclear when a specific act should be considered an act of war examples of cyberwarfare driven by political motivations can be found worldwide in 2008 russia began a cyber attack on the georgian government website which was carried out along with georgian military operations in south ossetia in 2008 chinese nationalist hackers attacked cnn as it reported on chinese repression on tibet jobs in cyberwarfare have become increasingly popular in the military all four branches of the united states military actively recruit for cyber warfare positions civil potential targets in internet sabotage include all aspects of the internet from the backbones of the web to the internet service providers to the varying types of data communication mediums and network equipment this would include web servers enterprise information systems client server systems communication links network equipment and the desktops and laptops in businesses and homes electrical grids financial networks and telecommunication systems are also deemed vulnerable especially due to current trends in computerization and automation hacktivism politically motivated hacktivism involves the subversive use of computers and computer networks to promote an agenda and can potentially extend to attacks theft and virtual sabotage that could be seen as cyberwarfare or mistaken for it hacktivists use their knowledge and software tools to gain unauthorized access to computer systems they seek to manipulate or damage not for material gain or to cause widespread destruction but to draw attention to their cause through wellpublicized disruptions of select targets anonymous and other hacktivist groups are often portrayed in the media as cyberterrorists wreaking havoc by hacking websites posting sensitive information about their victims and threatening further attacks if their demands are not met however hacktivism is more than that they are politically motivated to change the world through the use of fundamentalism groups like anonymous have divided opinion with their methods private sector further information cyberarms industry and market for zeroday exploits computer hacking represents a modern threat in ongoing global conflicts and industrial espionage and as such is presumed to widely occur this type of crime is usually financially motivated nonprofit research but not all examinations with the issue of cyberwarfare are achieving profit or personal gain there are still institutes and companies like the university of cincinnati or the kaspersky security lab which are trying to increase the sensibility of this topic by researching and publishing of new security threats by region approximately 120 countries have been developing ways to use the internet as a weapon and target financial markets government computer systems and utilities asia china cyberwarfare in the peoples republic of china see also chinese intelligence activity abroad chinese intelligence operations in the united states and chinese information operations and information warfare foreign policy magazine puts the size of chinas hacker army at anywhere from 50000 to 100000 individuals diplomatic cables highlight us concerns that china is using access to microsoft source code and harvesting the talents of its private sector to boost its offensive and defensive capabilities a 2008 article in the culture mandala the bulletin of the centre for eastwest cultural and economic studies by jason fritz alleges that the chinese government from 1995 to 2008 was involved in a number of highprofile cases of espionage primarily through the use of a decentralized network of students business people scientists diplomats and engineers from within the chinese diaspora while china continues to be held responsible for a string of cyberattacks on a number of public and private institutions in the united states india russia canada and france the chinese government denies any involvement in cyberspying campaigns the administration maintains the position that china is not the threat but rather the victim of an increasing number of cyberattacks most reports about chinas cyber warfare capabilities have yet to be confirmed by the chinese government according to fritz china has expanded its cyber capabilities and military technology by acquiring foreign military technology in response to reports of cyberattacks by china against the united states amitai etzioni of the institute for communitarian policy studies has suggested that china and the united states agree to a policy of mutually assured restraint with respect to cyberspace this would involve allowing both states to take the measures they deem necessary for their selfdefense while simultaneously agreeing to refrain from taking offensive steps it would also entail vetting these commitments operation shady rat is an ongoing series of cyber attacks starting mid2006 reported by internet security company mcafee in august 2011 china is widely believed to be the state actor behind these attacks which hit at least 72 organizations including governments and defense contractors india see also national cyber security policy 2013 the department of information technology created the indian computer emergency response team certin in 2004 to thwart cyber attacks in india that year there were 23 reported cyber security breaches in 2011 there were 13301 that year the government created a new subdivision the national critical information infrastructure protection centre nciipc to thwart attacks against energy transport banking telecom defence space and other sensitive areas the executive director of the nuclear power corporation of india npcil stated in february 2013 that his company alone was forced to block up to ten targeted attacks a day certin was left to protect less critical sectors a highprofile cyber attack on 12 july 2012 breached the email accounts of about 12000 people including those of officials from the ministry of external affairs ministry of home affairs defence research and development organisation drdo and the indotibetan border police itbp in february 2013 information technology secretary j satyanarayana stated that the nciipc other steps include the isolation of various security agencies to ensure that a synchronised attack could not succeed on all fronts and the planned appointment of a national cyber security coordinator as of that month there had been no significant economic or physical damage to india related to cyber attacks on 26 november 2010 a group calling itself the indian cyber army hacked the websites belonging to the pakistan army and the others belong to different ministries including the ministry of foreign affairs ministry of education ministry of finance pakistan computer bureau council of islamic ideology etc the attack was done as a revenge for the mumbai terrorist attacks on 4 december 2010 a group calling itself the pakistan cyber army hacked the website of indias top investigating agency the central bureau of investigation cbi the national informatics center nic has begun an inquiry in july 2016 cymmetria researchers discovered and revealed the cyber attack dubbed patchwork which compromised an estimated 2500 corporate and government agencies using code stolen from github and the dark web examples of weapons used are an exploit for the sandworm vulnerability cve20144114 a compiled autoit script and uac bypass code dubbed uacme targets are believed to be mainly military and political assignments around southeast asia and the south china sea and the attackers are believed to be of indian origin and gathering intelligence from influential parties philippines the chinese are being blamed after a cybersecurity company fsecure labs found a malware nanhaishu which targeted the philippines department of justice it sent information in an infected machine to a server with a chinese ip address the malware which is considered particularly sophisticated in nature was introduced by phishing emails that were designed to look like they were coming from an authentic sources the information sent is believed to be relating to the south china sea legal case russia cyberwarfare in russia when russia was still a part of the soviet union in 1982 a portion of its transsiberia pipeline within its territory exploded allegedly due to computer malware implanted in the pirated canadian software by the central intelligence agency the malware caused the scada system running the pipeline to malfunction the farewell dossier provided information on this attack and wrote that compromised computer chips would become a part of soviet military equipment flawed turbines would be placed in the gas pipeline and defective plans would disrupt the output of chemical plants and a tractor factor this caused the most monumental nonnuclear explosion and fire ever seen from space however the soviet union did not blame the united states for the attack russian south ossetian georgian and azerbaijani sites were attacked by hackers during the 2008 south ossetia war russianled cyberattacks 2007 cyberattacks on estonia cyberattacks during the russogeorgian war and russian interference in

2013 south korea cyberattack in july 2009 there were a series of coordinated denial of service attacks against major government news media and financial websites in south korea and the united states visualization of 2009 cyber warfare attacks against south korea in july 2011 the south korean company sk communications was hacked resulting in the theft of the personal details including names phone numbers home and email addresses and resident registration numbers of up to 35 million people a trojaned software update was used to gain access to the sk communications network links exist between this hack and other malicious activity and it is believed to be part of a broader concerted hacking effort with ongoing tensions on the korean peninsula south koreas defense ministry stated that south korea was going to improve cyberdefense strategies in hopes of preparing itself from possible cyber attacks in march 2013 south koreas major banks shinhan bank woori bank and nonghyup bank as well as many broadcasting stations kbs ytn and mbc were hacked and more than 30000 computers were affected it is one of the biggest attacks south korea has faced in years north korea further information sony

used in military exercises ukraine according to crowdstrike from 2014 to 2016 the russian apt fancy bear used android malware to target the ukrainian armys rocket forces and artillery they distributed an infected version of an android app whose original purpose was to control targeting data for the d30 howitzer artillery the app used by ukrainian officers was loaded with the xagent spyware and posted online on military forums the attack was claimed by crowdstrike to be successful with more than 80 of ukrainian d30 howitzers destroyed the highest percentage loss of any artillery pieces in the army a percentage that had never been previously reported and would mean the loss of nearly the entire arsenal of the biggest artillery piece of the ukrainian armed forces in 2014 the russians were suspected to use a cyber weapon called snake or ouroboros to conduct a cyber attack on ukraine during a period of political turmoil the snake tool kit began spreading into ukrainian computer systems in 2010 it performed computer network exploitation cne as well as highly sophisticated computer network attacks cna on december 23 2015 the blackenergy malware was used in a cyberattack on ukraines powergrid that left more than 200000 people temporarily without power a mining company and a large railway operator were also victims of the attack united kingdom mi6 reportedly infiltrated an al qaeda website and replaced the instructions for making a pipe bomb with the recipe for making cupcakes in october 2010 iain lobban the director of the government communications headquarters gchq said the uk faces a real and credible threat from cyber attacks by hostile states and criminals and government systems are targeted 1000 times each month such attacks threatened the uks economic

government by causing destruction to the state owned national oil company saudi aramco the attackers posted a pastie on pastebincom hours prior to the wiper logic bomb occurring citing oppression and the alsaud regime as a reason behind the attack shamoon 1 attack timeline against saudi aramco kubecka also detailed in her black hat usa talk saudi aramco placed the majority of their security budget on the ics control network leaving the business network at risk for a major incident when you realize most of your security budget was spent on ics it gets pwnd saudi aramco announced the attack on their facebook page and went offline again until a company statement was issued on 25 august 2012 the statement falsely reported normal business was resumed on 25 august 2012 however a middle eastern journalist leaked photographs taken on 1 september 2012 showing kilometers of petrol trucks unable to be loaded due to backed business systems still inoperable tanker trucks unable to be loaded with gasoline due to shamoon attacks on august 29 2012 the same attackers behind shamoon posted another pastie on pastebincom taunting saudi aramco with proof they still retained access to the company network the post contained the username and password on security and network equipment and the new password for the ceo khalid al falih the attackers also referenced a portion of the shamoon malware

washington north america united states cyberwarfare in the united states cyberwarfare in the united states is a part of the american military strategy of proactive cyber defence and the use of cyberwarfare as a platform for attack in 2013 cyberwarfare was for the first time considered a larger threat than al qaeda or terrorism by many us intelligence officials in 2017 representative mike rogers chairman of the us house permanent select committee on intelligence for instance said that we are in a cyber war in this country and most americans dont know it and we are not necessarily winning we have got huge challenges when it comes to cybersecurity us government security expert richard a clarke in his book cyber war may 2010 defines cyberwarfare as actions by a nationstate to penetrate another nations computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption in 2009 president barack obama declared americas digital infrastructure to be a strategic national asset and in may 2010 the pentagon set up its new us cyber command uscybercom headed by general keith b alexander director of the national security agency nsa to defend american military networks and attack other countries systems the eu has set up enisa european union agency for network and information security which is headed by prof udo helmbrecht and there are now further plans to significantly expand enisas capabilities the united kingdom has also set up a cybersecurity and operations centre based in government communications headquarters gchq the british equivalent of the nsa in the us however cyber command is only set up to protect the military whereas the government and corporate infrastructures are primarily the responsibility respectively of the department of homeland security and private companies in february 2010 top american lawmakers warned that the threat of a crippling attack on telecommunications and computer networks was sharply on the rise the economist writes that china has plans of winning informationised wars by the mid21st century they note that other countries are likewise organizing for cyberwar among them russia israel and north korea iran boasts of having the worlds secondlargest cyberarmy in january 2012 mike mcconnell the former director of national intelligence at the national security agency under president george w bush told the reuters news agency that the us has already launched attacks on computer networks in other countries in august 2010 the us for the first time warned publicly about the chinese militarys use of civilian computer experts in clandestine cyber attacks aimed at american companies and government agencies the pentagon also pointed to an alleged chinabased computer spying network dubbed ghostnet that was revealed in a research report last year the pentagon stated the peoples liberation army is using information warfare units to develop viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks and those units include civilian computer professionals commander bob mehal will monitor the plas buildup of its cyberwarfare capabilities and will continue to develop capabilities to counter any potential threat the united states department of defense sees the use of computers and the internet to conduct warfare in cyberspace as a threat to national security the united states joint forces command describes some of its attributes cyberspace technology is emerging as an instrument of power in societies and is becoming more available to a countrys opponents who may use it to attack degrade and disrupt communications and the flow of information with low barriers to entry coupled with the anonymous nature of activities in cyberspace the list of potential adversaries is broad furthermore the globespanning range of cyberspace and its disregard for national borders will challenge legal systems and complicate a nations ability to deter threats and respond to contingencies in february 2010 the united states joint forces command released a study which included a summary of the threats posed by the internet with very little investment and cloaked in a veil of anonymity our adversaries will inevitably attempt to harm our national interests cyberspace will become a main front in both irregular and traditional conflicts enemies in cyberspace will include both states and nonstates and will range from the unsophisticated amateur to highly trained professional hackers through cyberspace enemies will target industry academia government as well as the military in the air land maritime and space domains in much the same way that airpower transformed the battlefield of world war ii cyberspace has fractured the physical barriers that shield a nation from attacks on its commerce and communication indeed adversaries have already taken advantage of computer networks and the power of information technology not only to plan and execute savage acts of terrorism but also to influence directly the perceptions and will of the us government and the american population on 6 october 2011 it was announced that creech afbs drone and predator fleets command and control data stream had been keylogged resisting all attempts to reverse the exploit for the past two weeks on 21 november 2011 it was widely reported in the us media that a hacker had destroyed a water pump at the currangardner township public water district in illinois according to the foreign policy magazine nsas tailored access operations tao unit has successfully penetrated chinese computer and telecommunications systems for almost 15 years generating some of the best and most reliable intelligence information about what is going on inside the peoples republic of china on 24 november 2014 the sony pictures entertainment hack was a release of confidential data belonging to sony pictures entertainment spe in june 2015 the united states office of personnel management opm announced that it had been the target of a data breach targeting the records of as many as four million people in 2016 jeh johnson the united states secretary of homeland security and james clapper the us director of national intelligence issued a joint statement accusing russia of interfering with the 2016 united states presidential election the united states has used cyberattacks for tactical advantage in afghanistan in 2014 barack obama ordered an intensification of cyberwarfare against north koreas missile program for sabotaging test launches in their opening seconds in march 2017 wikileaks has published more than 8000 documents on the cia the confidential documents codenamed vault 7 and dated from 20132016 include details on cias software capabilities such as the ability to compromise cars smart tvs for a global perspective of countries and other actors engaged in cyber warfare see the george washington universitybased national security archives cyberwar map kill switch bill on 19 june 2010 united states senator joe lieberman ict introduced a bill called protecting cyberspace as a national asset act of 2010 cyberpeace see also cyberweapon control and disarmament the rise of cyber as a warfighting domain has led to efforts to determine how cyberspace can be used to foster peace for example the german civil rights panel fiff runs a campaign for cyberpeace for the control of cyberweapons and surveillance technology and against the militarization of cyberspace and the development and stockpiling of offensive exploits and malware the topics of cyber peacekeeping have also been studied by researchers as a way to restore and strengthen peace in the aftermath of both cyber and traditional warfare cyber counterintelligence cyber counterintelligence are measures to identify penetrate or neutralize foreign operations that use cyber means as the primary tradecraft methodology as well as foreign intelligence service collection efforts that use traditional methods to gauge cyber capabilities and intentions on 7 april 2009 the pentagon announced they spent more than 100million in the last six months responding to and repairing damage from cyber attacks and other computer network problems on 1 april 2009 us lawmakers pushed for the appointment of a white house cyber security czar to dramatically escalate us defenses against cyber attacks crafting proposals that would empower the government to set and enforce security standards for private industry for the first time on 9 february 2009 the white house announced that it will conduct a review of the nations cyber security to ensure that the federal government of the united states cyber security initiatives are appropriately integrated resourced and coordinated with the united states congress and the private sector in the wake of the 2007 cyberwar waged against estonia nato established the cooperative cyber defence centre of excellence ccd coe in tallinn estonia in order to enhance the organizations cyber defence capability the center was formally established on 14 may 2008 and it received full accreditation by nato and attained the status of international military organization on 28 october 2008 in 2015 the department of defense released an updated cyber strategy memorandum detailing the present and future tactics deployed in the service of defense against cyberwarfare in this memorandum three cybermissions are laid out the first cybermission seeks to arm and maintain existing capabilities in the area of cyberspace the second cybermission focuses on prevention of cyberwarfare and the third cybermission includes strategies for retaliation and preemption as distinguished from prevention one of the hardest issues in cyber counterintelligence is the problem of attribution unlike conventional warfare figuring out who is behind an attack can be very difficult controversy over terms there is debate on whether the term cyberwarfare is accurate eugene kaspersky founder of kaspersky lab concludes that cyberterrorism is a more accurate term than cyberwar he states that with todays attacks you are clueless about who did it or when they will strike again its not cyberwar but cyberterrorism in october 2011 the journal of strategic studies a leading journal in that field published an article by thomas rid cyber war will not take place which argued that all politically motivated cyber attacks are merely sophisticated versions of sabotage espionage or subversion and that it is unlikely that cyber war will occur in the future howard schmidt an american cybersecurity expert argued in march 2010 that there is no cyberwar i think that is a terrible metaphor and i think that is a terrible concept there are no winners in that environment other experts however believe that this type of activity already constitutes a war the warfare analogy is often seen intended to motivate a militaristic response when that is not necessarily appropriate ron deibert of canadas citizen lab has warned of a militarization of cyberspace the european cybersecurity expert sandro gaycken argued for a middle position he considers cyberwar from a legal perspective an unlikely scenario due to the reasons lined out by rid and before him sommer oxford academic lucas kello proposed a new term unpeace to denote highly damaging cyber actions whose nonviolent effects do not rise to the level of traditional war such actions are neither warlike nor peacelike although they are nonviolent and thus not acts of war their damaging effects on the economy and society may be greater than even some armed attacks the idea of a cyber pearl harbor has been debated by scholars drawing an analogy to the historical act of war legal issues various parties have attempted to come up with international legal frameworks to clarify what is and is not acceptable but none have yet been widely accepted the tallinn manual published in 2013 is an academic nonbinding study on how international law in particular the jus ad bellum and international humanitarian law apply to cyber conflicts and cyber warfare it was written at the invitation of the tallinnbased nato cooperative cyber defence centre of excellence by an international group of approximately twenty experts between 2009 and 2012 the shanghai cooperation organisation members of which include china and russia defines cyberwar to include dissemination of information harmful to the spiritual moral and cultural spheres of other states in september 2011 these countries proposed to the un secretary general a document called international code of conduct for information security in contrast the united states approach focuses on physical and economic damage and injury putting political concerns under freedom of speech this difference of opinion has led to reluctance in the west to pursue global cyber arms control agreements however american general keith b alexander did endorse talks with russia over a proposal to limit military attacks in cyberspace a ukrainian professor of international law alexander merezhko has developed a project called the international convention on prohibition of cyberwar in internet according to this project cyberwar is defined as the use of internet and related technological means by one state against the political economic technological and information sovereignty and independence of another state professor merezhkos project suggests that the internet ought to remain free from warfare tactics and be treated as an international landmark he states that the internet cyberspace is a common heritage of mankind on the february 2017 rsa conference microsoft president brad smith suggested global rules a digital geneva convention for cyber attacks that ban the nationstate hacking of all the civilian aspects of our economic and political infrastructures he also stated that an independent organization could investigate and publicly disclose evidence that attributes nationstate attacks to specific countries furthermore he said that the technology sector should collectively and neutrally work together to protect internet users and pledge to remain

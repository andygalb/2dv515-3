computer science electrical and electronics engineering vte devops a clipped compound of development and operations is a software development methodology that combines software development dev with information technology operations ops the goal of devops is to shorten the systems development life cycle while also delivering features fixes and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives definition venn diagram showing devops as the intersection of development software engineering operations and quality assurance qa academics and practitioners have not developed a unique definition for the term devops from an academic perspective len bass ingo weber and liming zhucomputer science researchers from the software engineering institutesuggested to define devops as a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production while ensuring high quality the term devops however has been used in multiple contexts history in 2009 patrick debois coined the term toolchain illustration showing stages in a devops toolchain devops toolchain as devops is intended to be a crossfunctional mode of working rather than a single devops tool there are sets or toolchains of multiple tools code code development and review source code management tools code merging build continuous integration tools build status test continuous testing tools that provide feedback on business risks package artifact repository application predeployment staging release change management release approvals release automation configure infrastructure configuration and management infrastructure as code tools monitor applications performance monitoring enduser experience note that there exist different interpretations of the devops toolchain eg plan create verify package release configure and monitor some categories are more essential in a devops toolchain than others especially continuous integration eg jenkins and infrastructure as code eg puppet relationship to other approaches agile agile software development the need for devops arose from the increasing success of agile software development archops archops presents an extension for devops practice starting from software architecture artifacts instead of source code for operation deployment archops states that architectural models are firstclass entities in software development deployment and operations bizdevops another practice that rose from devops is bizdevops which inserts business drivers as aspect equal to development and operations continuous delivery continuous delivery continuous delivery and devops have common goals and are often used in conjunction but there are subtle differences while continuous delivery is focused on automating the processes in software delivery devops also focuses on the organization change to support great collaboration between the many functions involved devops and continuous delivery share a common background in agile methods and lean thinking small and frequent changes with focused value to the end customer dataops dataops the application of continuous delivery and devops to data analytics has been termed dataops dataops seeks to integrate data engineering data integration data quality data security and data privacy with operations devsecops devsecops is another practice that rose from devops that includes information technology security as a fundamental aspect in all the stages of software development opsdev opsdev site reliability

maintaining highquality end user experience systems administration this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it june 2018 devops is often viewed as an approach to applying systems administration work to cloud technology winops winops winops is the term used for devops practices for a microsoftcentric view goals the goals of devops span the entire delivery pipeline they include improved deployment frequency faster time to market lower failure rate of new releases shortened lead time between fixes faster mean time to recovery in the event of a new release crashing or otherwise disabling the current system simple processes become increasingly programmable and dynamic using a devops approach devops aims to maximize the predictability efficiency security and maintainability of operational processes very often automation supports this objective devops integration targets product delivery continuous testing quality testing feature development and maintenance releases in order to improve reliability and security and provide faster development and deployment cycles many of the ideas and people involved in devops came from the enterprise systems management and agile software development movements views on the benefits claimed for devops companies that practice devops have reported significant benefits including significantly shorter time to market improved customer satisfaction better product quality more reliable releases improved productivity and efficiency and the increased ability to build the right product by fast experimentation however a study released in january 2017 by f5 of almost 2200 it executives and industry professionals found that only one in five surveyed think devops had a strategic impact on their organization despite rise in usage the same study found that only 17 identified devops as key well below software as a service 42 big data 41 and public cloud infrastructure as a service 39 cultural change devops initiatives can create cultural changes in companies devops as a job title while devops describes an approach to work rather than a distinct role like system administrator job advertisements are increasingly using terms like devops engineer while devops reflects complex topics the devops community uses analogies to communicate important concepts much like the cathedral and the bazaar from the open source community cattle not pets the paradigm of disposable server infrastructure 10 deployments per day the story of flickr adopting devops building a devops culture devops tshirt worn at a computer conference devops principles demand strong interdepartmental communication teambuilding and other employee engagement activities are often used to create an environment that fosters this communication and cultural change within an organization deployment companies with very frequent releases may require a devops awareness or orientation program for example the company that operates the image hosting website flickr developed a devops approach to support a business requirement of ten deployments per day architecturally significant requirements to practice devops effectively software applications have to meet a set of architecturally significant requirements asrs such as deployability modifiability testability and monitorability these asrs require a high priority and cannot be traded off lightly although in principle it is possible to practice devops with any architectural style the microservices architectural style is becoming the standard for building continuously deployed systems and continuously scope of adoption some articles in the devops literature assume or recommend significant participation in devops initiatives from outside an organizations it department eg devops is just the agile principle taken to the full enterprise a survey published in january 2016 by the saas cloudcomputing company rightscale devops adoption increased from 66 percent in 2015 to 74 percent in 2016 and among larger enterprise organizations devops adoption is even higher 81 percent adoption of devops is being driven by many factors including use of agile and other development processes and methods demand for an increased rate of production releases from application and business unit stakeholders wide availability of virtualized and cloud infrastructure from internal and external providers increased usage of data center automation and configuration management tools increased focus on test automation and continuous integration methods a critical mass of publiclyavailable best practices devops automation this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it june 2018 devops automation is a software engineering practice which aims at eliminating manual handoffs aligning siloed dev and ops departments and delivering releasedriven systems through the utilization of automation tools in development test stage and production

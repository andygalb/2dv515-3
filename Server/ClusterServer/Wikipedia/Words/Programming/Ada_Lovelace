ada lovelace augusta ada king countess of lovelace ne byron 10 december 1815 27 november 1852 was an english mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on charles babbages proposed mechanical generalpurpose computer the analytical engine she was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine as a result she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a computing machine and the first computer programmer lovelace was the only legitimate child of the poet lord byron and his wife anne isabella annabella milbanke lady wentworth he died of disease in the greek war of independence when ada was eight years old her mother remained bitter and promoted adas interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her fathers perceived insanity despite this ada remained interested in byron and was upon her eventual death buried next to him at her request she was often ill in her childhood ada married william king in 1835 king was made earl of lovelace in 1838 and ada in turn became countess of lovelace her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as andrew crosse sir david brewster charles wheatstone michael faraday and the author charles dickens contacts which she used to further her education ada described her approach as poetical science when she was a teenager her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow british mathematician charles babbage also known as the father of computers and in particular babbages work on the analytical engine lovelace first met him in june 1833 through their mutual friend and her private tutor mary somerville between 1842 and 1843 ada translated an article by italian military engineer luigi menabrea on the engine supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes simply called notes these notes contain what many consider to be the first computer programthat is an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine lovelaces notes are important in the early history of computers she also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or numbercrunching while many others including babbage himself focused only on those capabilities she died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36 biography early life ada aged four byron expected his baby to be a glorious boy and was disappointed when his wife gave birth to a girl on 16 january 1816 adas mother annabella at byrons command left for her parents home at kirkby mallory taking onemonthold ada with her ada aged seven by alfred dorsay 1822 somerville college oxford this set of events made ada famous in victorian society byron did not have a relationship with his daughter and never saw her again he died in 1824 when she was eight years old her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life her mother became baroness wentworth in her own right in 1856 annabella did not have a close relationship with the young ada and often left her in the care of her own mother judith hon lady milbanke who doted on her grandchild however because of societal attitudes of the timewhich favoured the husband in any separation with the welfare of any child acting as mitigationannabella had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society this included writing anxious letters to lady milbanke about adas welfare with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern ada aged seventeen 1832 ada was often ill beginning in early childhood at the age of eight she experienced headaches that obscured her vision in early 1833 ada had an affair with a tutor after being caught she tried to elope with him but the tutors relatives recognised her and contacted her mother annabella and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal adult years watercolor portrait of ada king countess of lovelace circa 1840 possibly by alfred edward chalon lovelace became close friends with her tutor mary somerville who introduced her to charles babbage in 1833 she had a strong respect and affection for somerville on 8 july 1835 she married william 8th baron king becoming lady king they had three children byron born 12 may 1836 anne isabella called annabella born 22 september 1837 and ralph gordon born 2 july 1839 immediately after the birth of annabella lady king experienced a tedious and suffering illness which took months to cure in 1841 lovelace and medora leigh the daughter of lord byrons halfsister augusta leigh were told by adas mother that her father was also medoras father education throughout her illnesses she continued her education lovelace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating poetry and science while studying differential calculus she wrote to de morgan i may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight is i think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies i am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of who are at ones elbows in one shape now and the next minute in a form most dissimilar lovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts she valued metaphysics as much as mathematics viewing both as tools for exploring the unseen worlds around us death painting of ada lovelace at a piano in 1852 by henry phillips while she was in great pain at the time she sat for the painting as phillips father thomas phillips had painted adas father lord byron lovelace died at the age of 36 the same age that her father had died on 27 november 1852 she was buried at her request next to her father at the church of st mary magdalene in hucknall nottinghamshire a memorial plaque in latin to her and her father is in the chapel attached to horsley towers work throughout her life lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day including phrenology portrait of ada by british painter margaret sarah carpenter 1836 lovelace first met charles babbage in june 1833 through their mutual friend mary somerville later that month babbage invited lovelace to see the prototype for his difference engine in 1843 he wrote to her mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0

short but the enchantress of number during a ninemonth period in 184243 lovelace translated the italian mathematician luigi menabreas article on babbages newest proposed machine the analytical engine with the article she appended a set of notes the notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include in section g section g also contains lovelaces dismissal of artificial intelligence she wrote that the analytical engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything it can do whatever we know how to order it to perform it can follow analysis but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths this objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal for example by alan turing in his paper computing machinery and intelligence lovelace and babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published when he tried to leave his own statement a criticism of the governments treatment of his engine as an unsigned prefacewhich would imply that she had written that also when taylors scientific memoirs ruled that the statement should be signed babbage wrote to lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper this was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper the historian benjamin woolley theorised that his actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought adas involvement and so happily indulged her because of her celebrated name first computer program lovelaces diagram from note g the first published computer algorithm in 1840 babbage was invited to give a seminar at the university of turin about his analytical engine luigi menabrea a young italian engineer and the future prime minister of italy transcribed babbages lecture into french and this transcript was subsequently published in the bibliothque universelle de genve in october 1842 babbages friend charles wheatstone commissioned ada lovelace to translate menabreas paper into english she then augmented the paper with notes which were added to the translation ada lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this assisted with input from babbage these notes which are more extensive than menabreas paper were then published in the september 1843 edition of taylors scientific memoirs under the initialism aal ada lovelaces notes were labelled alphabetically from a to g in note g she describes an algorithm for the analytical engine to compute bernoulli numbers it is considered the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer and ada lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason in 1953 more than a century after her death ada lovelaces notes on babbages analytical engine were republished as an appendix to bv bowdens faster than thought a symposium on digital computing machines beyond numbers in her notes lovelace emphasised the difference between the analytical engine and previous calculating machines particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity she realised the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crunching in her notes she wrote this analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised walter isaacson ascribes lovelaces insight regarding the application of computing to any process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles when she saw some mechanical looms that used punchcards to direct the weaving of beautiful patterns it reminded her of how babbages engine used punched cards to make calculations according to the historian of computing and babbage specialist doron swade ada saw something that babbage in some sense failed to see in babbages world his engines were bound by numberwhat lovelace sawwhat ada byron sawwas that number could represent entities other than quantity so once you had a machine for manipulating numbers if those numbers represented other things letters musical notes then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance according to rules it is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computationto generalpurpose computationand looking back from the present high ground of modern computing if we are looking and sifting history for that transition then that transition was made explicitly by ada in that 1843 paper controversy over extent of contributions though lovelace is referred to as the first computer programmer some biographers and historians of computing claim otherwise allan g bromley in the 1990 article difference and analytical engines all but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by babbage from three to seven years earlier the exception was prepared by babbage for her although she did detect a bug in it not only is there no evidence that ada ever prepared a program for the analytical engine but her correspondence with babbage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so bruce collier who later wrote a biography of babbage wrote in his 1970 harvard university phd thesis that lovelace made a considerable contribution to publicizing the analytical engine but there is no evidence that she advanced the design or theory of it in any way eugene eric kim and betty alexandra toole consider it incorrect to regard lovelace as the first computer programmer as babbage wrote the initial programs for his analytical engine although the majority were never published in his book idea makers stephen wolfram defends lovelaces contributions while acknowledging that babbage wrote several unpublished algorithms for the analytical engine prior to lovelaces notes wolfram argues that theres nothing as sophisticatedor as cleanas adas computation of the bernoulli numbers babbage certainly helped and commented on adas work but she was definitely the driver of it wolfram then suggests that lovelaces main achievement was to distill from babbages correspondence a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machinesomething which babbage never did doron swade a specialist on history of computing known for his work on babbage analyzed four claims about lovelace during a lecture on babbages analytical engine she was a mathematical genius she made an influential contribution to the analytical engine she was the first computer programmer she was a prophet of the computer age according to him only the fourth claim had any substance at all he explained that ada was only a promising beginner instead of genius in mathematics that she began studying basic concepts of mathematics five years after babbage conceived the analytical engine so she couldnt have made important contributions to it and that she only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it but he agrees that ada was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities in popular culture an illustration inspired by the a e chalon portrait created for the ada initiative which supported open technology and women lovelace has been portrayed in romulus linneys 1977 play childe byron in tom stoppards 1993 play arcadia the precocious teenage genius thomasina coverly a character apparently based on ada lovelacethe play also involves lord byron comes to understand chaos theory and theorises the second law of thermodynamics before either is officially recognised lovelace and babbage are the main characters in sydney paduas webcomic and graphic novel the thrilling adventures of lovelace and babbage the comic features extensive footnotes on the history of ada lovelace and many lines of dialogue are drawn from actual correspondence lovelace and mary shelley as teenagers are the central characters in jordan stratfords steampunk series the wollstonecraft detective agency as of november 2015 all new british passports have included an illustration of lovelace and babbage on pages 46 and 47 in 2017 a google doodle honoured her on international womens day the cardano platform uses ada as the

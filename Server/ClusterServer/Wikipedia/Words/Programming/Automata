automaton not to be confused with automation as a process this article is about a selfoperating machine for other uses see automaton disambiguation for automata see automata disambiguation pinocchio automaton an automaton tmtn plural automata or automatons is a selfoperating machine or a machine or control mechanism designed to automatically follow a predetermined sequence of operations or respond to predetermined instructions some automata such as bellstrikers in mechanical clocks are designed to give the illusion to the casual observer that they are operating under their own power etymology the word automaton is the latinization of the greek automaton neuter acting of ones own will this word was first used by homer to describe automatic door opening it is more often used to describe nonelectronic moving machines especially those that have been made to resemble human or animal actions such as the jacks on old public striking clocks or the cuckoo and any other animated figures on a cuckoo clock history ancient the book about automata by hero of alexandria 1589 edition there are many examples of automata in greek mythology hephaestus created automata for his workshop the automata in the hellenistic world were intended as tools toys religious idols or prototypes for demonstrating basic scientific principles numerous water powered automata were built by ktesibios a greek inventor and the first head of the great library of alexandria for example he used water to sound a whistle and make a model owl move he had invented the worlds first cuckoo clock the antikythera mechanism from 150100 bc was designed to calculate the positions of astronomical objects complex mechanical devices are known to have existed in hellenistic greece though the only surviving example is the antikythera mechanism the earliest known analog computer it is thought to have come originally from rhodes where there was apparently a tradition of mechanical engineering the island was renowned for its automata to quote pindars seventh olympic ode the animated figures stand adorning every public street and seem to breathe in stone or move their marble feet however the information gleaned from recent scans of the fragments indicate that it may have come from the colonies of corinth in sicily and implies a connection with archimedes according to jewish legend solomon used his wisdom to design a throne with mechanical animals which hailed him as king when he ascended it upon sitting down an eagle would place a crown upon his head and a dove would bring him a torah scroll its also said that when king solomon stepped upon the throne a mechanism was set in motion as soon as he stepped upon the first step a golden ox and a golden lion each stretched out one foot to support him and help him rise to the next step on each side the animals helped the king up until he was comfortably seated upon the throne in ancient china a curious account of automata is found in the lie zi text written in the 3rd century bc within it there is a description of a much earlier encounter between king mu of zhou 1023957 bc and a mechanical engineer known as yan shi an artificer the latter proudly presented the king with a lifesize humanshaped figure of his mechanical handiwork the king stared at the figure in astonishment it walked with rapid strides moving its head up and down so that anyone would have taken it for a live human being the artificer touched its chin and it began singing perfectly in tune he touched its hand and it began posturing keeping perfect timeas the performance was drawing to an end the robot winked its eye and made advances to the ladies in attendance whereupon the king became incensed and would have had yen shih other notable examples of automata include archytass dove mentioned by aulus gellius medieval the manufacturing tradition of automata continued in the greek world well into the middle ages on his visit to constantinople in 949 ambassador liutprand of cremona described automata in the emperor theophilos palace including lions made either of bronze or wood covered with gold which struck the ground with their tails and roared with open mouth and quivering tongue a tree of gilded bronze its branches filled with birds likewise made of bronze gilded over and these emitted cries appropriate to their species and the emperors throne itself which was made in such a cunning manner that at one moment it was down on the ground while at another it rose higher and was to be seen up in the air similar automata in the throne room singing birds roaring and moving lions were described by luitprands contemporary constantine porphyrogenitus who later became emperor in his book in the mid8th century the first wind powered automata were built statues that turned with the wind over the domes of the four gates and the palace complex of the round city of baghdad the public spectacle of windpowered statues had its private counterpart in the abbasid palaces where automata of various types were predominantly displayed automaton in the swiss museum cima play media an automaton writing a letter in swiss museum cima aljazari described complex programmable humanoid automata amongst other machines he designed and constructed in the book of knowledge of ingenious mechanical devices in 1206 aljazari constructed a hand washing automaton first employing the flush mechanism now used in modern toilets it features a female automaton standing by a basin filled with water when the user pulls the lever the water drains and the automaton refills the basin samarangana sutradhara a sanskrit treatise by bhoja 11th century includes a chapter about the construction of mechanical contrivances automata including mechanical bees and birds fountains shaped like humans and animals and male and female dolls that refilled oil lamps danced played instruments and reenacted scenes from hindu mythology villard de honnecourt in his 1230s sketchbook show plans for animal automata and an angel that perpetually turns to face the sun at the end of the thirteenth century robert ii count of artois built a pleasure garden at his castle at hesdin that incorporated several automata as entertainment in the walled park the work was conducted by local workmen and overseen by the italian knight renaud coignet it included monkey marionettes a sundial supported by lions and wild men mechanized birds mechanized fountains and a bellowsoperated organ the park was famed for its automata well into the fifteenth century before it was destroyed by english soldiers in the sixteenth the chinese author xiao xun wrote that when the ming dynasty founder hongwu r 13681398 was destroying the palaces of khanbaliq belonging to the previous yuan dynasty there wereamong many other mechanical devicesautomata found that were in the shape of tigers renaissance and early modern play media a cuckoo clock with a built in automaton of a cuckoo that flaps its wings and opens its beak in time to the sounds of the cuckoo call to mark the number of hours on the analogue dial elephant automaton at waddesdon manor the renaissance witnessed a considerable revival of interest in automata heros treatises were edited and translated into latin and italian giovanni fontana created mechanical devils and rocketpropelled animal automata numerous clockwork automata were manufactured in the 16th century principally by the goldsmiths of the free imperial cities of central europe these wondrous devices found a home in the cabinet of curiosities or wunderkammern of the princely courts of europe hydraulic and pneumatic automata similar to those described by hero were created for garden grottoes leonardo da vinci sketched a more complex automaton around the year 1495 the design of leonardos robot was not rediscovered until the 1950s the robot could if built successfully move its arms twist its head and sit up the smithsonian institution has in its collection a clockwork monk about 15in 380mm high possibly dating as early as 1560 the monk is driven by a keywound spring and walks the path of a square striking his chest with his right arm while raising and lowering a small wooden cross and rosary in his left hand turning and nodding his head rolling his eyes and mouthing silent obsequies from time to time he brings the cross to his lips and kisses it it is believed that the monk was manufactured by juanelo turriano mechanician to the holy roman emperor charles v a new attitude towards automata is to be found in descartes when he suggested that the bodies of animals are nothing more than complex machines the bones muscles and organs could be replaced with cogs pistons and cams thus mechanism became the standard to which nature and the organism was compared france in the 17th century was the birthplace of those ingenious mechanical toys that were to become prototypes for the engines of the industrial revolution thus in 1649 when louis xiv was still a child an artisan named camus designed for him a miniature coach and horses complete with footmen page and a lady within the coach all these figures exhibited a perfect movement according to p labat general de gennes constructed in 1688 in addition to machines for gunnery and navigation a peacock that walked and ate athanasius kircher produced many automata to create jesuit shows including a statue which spoke and listened via a speaking tube a japanese automata theater in osaka drawn in 18th century the takeda family opened their automata theater in 1662 the worlds first successfullybuilt biomechanical automaton is considered to be the flute player invented by the french engineer jacques de vaucanson in 1737 he also constructed the digesting duck a mechanical duck that gave the false illusion of eating and defecating seeming to endorse cartesian ideas that animals are no more than machines of flesh in 1769 a chessplaying machine called the turk created by wolfgang von kempelen made the rounds of the courts of europe purporting to be an automaton the turk was operated from inside by a hidden human director and was not a true automaton play media maillardets automaton is drawing a picture other 18th century automaton makers include the prolific swiss pierre jaquetdroz see jaquetdroz automata and his contemporary henri maillardet maillardet a swiss mechanic created an automaton capable of drawing four pictures and writing three poems maillardets automaton is now part of the collections at the franklin institute science museum in philadelphia belgianborn john joseph merlin created the mechanism of the silver swan automaton now at bowes museum tipus tiger is another late18th century example of automata made for tipu sultan featuring a european soldier being mauled by a tiger according to philosopher michel foucault frederick the great king of prussia from 1740 to 1786 was obsessed with automata according to manuel de landa he put together his armies as a welloiled clockwork mechanism whose components were robotlike warriors japan adopted automata during the edo period 16031867 they were known as karakuri ningy automata particularly watches and clocks were popular in china during the 18th and 19th centuries and items were produced for the chinese market strong interest by chinese collectors in the 21st century brought many interesting items to market where they have had dramatic realizations modern a singing bird box made about 1890 by bontems bird dressed with iridescent hummingbird feathers and case made of tortoiseshell the famous magician jean eugne roberthoudin 18051871 was known for creating automata for his stage shows the fluteplayer by innocenzo manzetti 1840 in 1840 italian inventor innocenzo manzetti constructed a fluteplaying automaton in the shape of a man lifesize seated on a chair hidden inside the chair were levers connecting rods and compressed air tubes which made the automatons lips and fingers move on the flute according to a program recorded on a cylinder similar to those used in player pianos the automaton was powered by clockwork and could perform 12 different arias as part of the performance it would rise from the chair bow its head and roll its eyes teaserving japanese automaton karakuri ningy with mechanism right 19th century the period 1860 to 1910 is known as the golden age of automata during this period many small family based companies of automata makers thrived in paris from their workshops they exported thousands of clockwork automata and mechanical singing birds around the world it is these french automata that are collected today although now rare and expensive they attract collectors worldwide the main french makers were bontems lambert phalibois renou roullet decamps theroude and vichy contemporary automata continue this tradition with an emphasis on art rather than technological sophistication contemporary automata are represented by the works of cabaret mechanical theatre in the united kingdom dug north and chomickmeder arthur ganson joe jones in the united states le dfenseur du temps by french artist jacques monestier and franois junod in switzerland some mechanized toys developed during the 18th and 19th centuries were automata made with paper despite the relative simplicity of the material paper automata require a high degree of technical ingenuity one of the most advanced automata proposed to date is nasas automaton rover for extreme environments aree a windpowered automaton

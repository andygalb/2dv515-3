requirements engineering requirements engineering re in the engineering design process it is a common role in systems engineering and software engineering the first use of the term requirements engineering was probably in 1979 in trw technical report and the establishment of a conference series on requirements engineering that has evolved into the current international requirements engineering conference in the waterfall model requirements engineering is presented as the first phase of the development process later development methods including the rational unified process rup for software assume that requirements engineering continues through the lifetime of a system requirement management which is a subfunction of systems engineering practices is also indexed in the incose international council on systems engineering manuals activities the activities involved in requirements engineering vary widely depending on the type of system being developed and the specific practices of the organizations involved these may include requirements inception or requirements elicitation developers and stakeholders meet the latter are inquired concerning their needs and wants regarding the software product requirements analysis and negotiation requirements are identified including new ones if the development is iterative and conflicts with stakeholders are solved both written and graphical tools the latter commonly used in the design phase but some find them helpful at this stage too are successfully used as aids examples of written analysis tools use cases and user stories examples of graphical tools uml and lml system modeling some engineering fields or specific situations require the product to be completely designed and modeled before its construction or fabrication starts and therefore the design phase must be performed in advance for instance blueprints for a building must be elaborated before any contract can be approved and signed many fields might derive models of the system with the lifecycle modeling language whereas others might use uml note in many fields such as software engineering most modeling activities are classified as design activities and not as requirement engineering activities requirements specification requirements are documented in a formal artifact called requirements specification rs nevertheless it will become official only after validation a rs can contain both written and graphical models information if necessary example software requirements specification srs requirements validation checking that the documented requirements and models are consistent and meet the needs of the stakeholder only if the final draft passes the validation process the rs becomes official requirements management managing all the activities related to the requirements since inception supervising as the system is developed and even until after it is put into use e g changes extensions etc these are sometimes presented as chronological stages although in practice there is considerable interleaving of these activities problems one limited study in germany presented possible problems in implementing requirements engineering and asked respondents whether they agreed that they were actual problems the results were not presented as being generalizable but suggested that the principal perceived problems were incomplete requirements moving targets and time boxing with lesser problems being communications flaws lack of traceability terminological problems and unclear responsibilities criticism there is no evidence that requirements engineering contributes to the success of software projects or systems problem structuring a key aspect of requirements engineering decreases design performance requirements

calledisoiec jtc1sc7 software engineering isoiec jtc 1sc 7 software and systems engineering is a standardization subcommittee of the joint technical committee isoiec jtc 1 of the international organization for standardization iso and the international electrotechnical commission iec that develops and facilitates standards within the field of engineering of software products and systems the international secretariat of isoiec jtc 1sc 7 is the bureau of indian standards bis located in india history isoiec jtc 1sc 7 was first established in 1987 though the origins of the subcommittee began with isotc 97 established in 1960 as a standardization technical committee in the field of information processing with the formation of isoiec jtc 1 in 1987 isotc 97 and iectc 83 were combined to form isoiec jtc 1sc 7 software engineering as of june2017 the next plenary meeting will be in new delhi india in may 2018 scope and mission the scope of isoiec jtc 1sc 7 is the standardization of processes supporting tools and supporting technologies for the engineering of software products and systems including software and systems engineering processes software system products enterprise architecture software engineering environment software engineering body of knowledge management of it assets the mission of isoiec jtc 1sc 7 is to provide quality standards that cover the entire lifecycle of information systems provide quality standards that meet user needs in broad markets manage the set of standards effectively through documented framework promote the use of standards by providing supporting materials provide leadership in standardization through a continuous technology watch process using study groups to explore new areas and markets the development of a comprehensive set of integrated standards with broad international and professional consensus initiating cooperative work with international professional and standards producing organizations a framework that facilitates the integration and subcontracting of standards developed in other standards producing organizations facilitates cooperative development of joint standards with other international standards producing organizations minimizes the inconsistencies between isoiec jtc 1sc 7 standards including those developed by other standards producing organizations structure isoiec jtc 1sc 7 is made up of 12 active working groups wgs three special working groups swgs and one task force each of these groups carries out specific tasks in standards development within the field of systems and software engineering as a response to standardization needs within the field of software and systems engineering working groups within isoiec jtc 1sc 7 were disbanded if their working area was no longer applicable or established if new working areas arose the focus of each working group special working group advisory group and task force is described in the groups terms of reference active working groups of isoiec
